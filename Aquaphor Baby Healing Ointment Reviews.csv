This product is AMAZING! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I don't love the slightly greasy texture and finish (it is not a lotion. Almost same texture as Vaseline). However, it is hands down the most hydrating and healing product I have ever used for my skin surpassing dermatologist prescribed healing ointments and steroids. My skin was WRECKED!

I finally had to quit when a new prescription caused me to experience contact dermatitis every time I went in the water. The damage was extensive. Within days of using this product my dried, scaly, cracked and bleeding skin was healing. My arm hair started growing back within a week. My cuticles stopped peeling back from the nails. And the most unanticipated additional use is phenomenal as a chub-rub protector and healer.
Since the weather is getting nicer, I've been hiking anywhere from 2-5 miles a day. Unfortunately on this past Monday eve, I wore the wrong leggings and experienced a terrible case of chub rub. It finally occurred to me last night after 3 days of suffering that I could use this close to my privates because it's usually used for diaper rash and on babies sensitive skin.

I like the tubs because it's easier to get the cream out. The squeeze bottles get slippery if the cream ends up on the bottle and the cream is super thick and hard to squeeze out so your baby will probably get bored while waiting, see something shiny, and crawl away before you've gotten any out.

I know someone who has had severe cracks on their hands from working in the cold - like the kind of cracks that hurt if they get wet. Deep too. Aquaphor has been a great help in healing the cracks and keeping them from getting worse. It also has taken care of bumps I get on the back of my thighs and upper arms (a common dermatology skin thing). I actually have started using it for my lips too. It's the most moisturizing thing I've used for my lips. I either just take it right out of the container or fill up an empty chapstick container with a screw on lid. Of course it doesn't keep them moist all day, but it does a better job than what I've been doing. And I have to keep consistent at it. It's not like you use it once and it's all better.

I received this last night around 7pm and immediantly changed my son and slathered this thick goo all over his sore bum. We recently tried out a different brand of wipes and his entire bum was fire engine red and started to welt and crack. It has been so raw it was physcially uncomfortable for him to even sit down. He has never had a diaper rash that was this bad. I even called my Drs office and asked if I should go in since he was bleeding. They calmly told me unless it gets even worse in the next few days as long as we removed the irritant it should go away on it's own. After reading a LOT of reviews I settled on trying this ointment because people swear by it. I understand why they do. I put it on him and changed his diaper once again before bed time and put on new cream and a new diaper. By the morning his rash looked AMAZING! It was no longer bright red but a dull pink and the welts were completely gone. I will be reapplying this every diaper change for the next few days and I'm sure it'll be gone.,true,false,

However, when our baby was around 5 1/2 months old, his skin condition turned very severe, thick patches were developing on his face, neck and wrists. The doctor confirmed that he had eczema. No amount of Aquaphor seemed to help. We then tried Aveeno Eczema lotion, Burt's Bee, Honest beeswax ointment with no improvement at all. I researched a lot and came across some articles on using bleach bath for baby eczema. I didn't want to use the bleach, so instead we took him to a swim lesson - our baby not only loved the swim class, as soon as he got out of the pool, I noticed a dramatic difference in his skin.

I bought it following a recommendation to use it as a base to mix with Honey to make Honey ointment.
The recipe is fairly simple: Mix it with Honey in equal parts, heat up under running hot water to reach about 105 degrees F and voila!

Honey is an amazing disinfectant. I can be used to heal burns, scratches, even after surgery but in itself, it is very sticky. This is why it is necessary to mix it with a greasy base like this ointment to make it more manageable.

We will put Aquaphor all over his body twice a day (especially right when he is done with his bath) to help with dryness. The only down side is he gets very greasy and shinny but it's worth is to keep his skin moisturized and not itchy. We highly recommend Aquarphor for your baby!!",true,false,

The doctor's are always finding this problem or that and of course severe diaper rash seemed to be a problem for my kids. One doctor recommended this before she ended up retiring and I was pushed towards other things by the next doctors. However, I always end up back to this. Although it says it clears up diaper rash within a certain amount of time, my kids have extremely sensitive skin so it sometimes takes longer. The main thing to remember is that the area that you are putting it on needs to be completely clean and dry or it will capture moisture under it and it may not work to its full potential. This helps with severely dry skin also. The best part is that it comes off my hands very well after using it on the kids. When my boys were little and I had to change them just about every hour, I would literally not leave home without this.

One other thing that I want to mention is that if you need to travel, this size of container is way too big (in my opinion). The ointment is very easy to remove from the container with a popsicle or craft stick of some kind and put it into a smaller container. Regular aquaphor is very thick and not as easy to use so if you are looking for something for your baby then you would most likely want BABY aquaphor instead of the regular aquaphor.",true,false,

They gave us a prescribed mix of aquaphor and desitin. It didn't work. My baby's skin broke down in his groin and it was raw skin exposed.
I used this aquaphor and alternated with Pinxav (also on Amazon) and it cleared right up. I used he Pinxav when he needed a little more healing power, and the aquaphor OINTMENT (not the cream with zinc in it, but the petroleum based one show here) when we needed more barrier (maybe his skin was less red but we still wanted to protect it from his messes). Using those two appropriately really helped to clear it up. Also the aquaphor was helpful in cleaning up his broken skin. It delicately sloughed it off as it healed. I typically try to go the all natural route and am not a fan of petroleum and mineral oil, but I'll use what works!!!",true,false,

But no matter how much paste I applied, her rash continued to worsen by the day and it had even got to the point to where she was bleeding and my daughter wouldn't even want to walk or play due to the severe discomfort.:( While researching what products would work fast I came across this brand. It claimed to relieve rashes within 6 hours and I decided to give it a try.
I can HONESTLY say that it has been two days and her rash is practically gone. After the first application, my daughter could sleep with ease and started to become her happy self again.

My 4 month old had horrible exzema. we tired at least 6 different exzema lotions, bleach bathes, no bathing, nightly bathing, various ointments (bagbalm,lanolin, vasaline), special oils that go in the tub, special shampoos and soaps. but to no avail. every product causes a severe rash or was completely ineffectual. Next we tried unrefined coconut oil. This did not work on her skin problems but I will give it some creadit as it got rid of her weeping craddle cap in 2 nights. I was about ready to give up. The pediatrician had no advice other than ""She will grow out of it."" but that was little solace when my poor baby was crying and trying to itch her enflamed and dry skin. I didnt just feelbad for her. It kept her up at nights. and if baby isnt sleeping no one is. lol. Then I posted something on facebook and no less than 10 mom chimed in and said aquaphor! So I looked it up. Now if you read the ingrediants its basically lanolin mixed with vasaline. it also has alcohol which AIDS in drying and mineral oil which every mom on ever baby forum says to avoid like the plegue if your baby has sensative skin. (and as a first time mom baby oil is an obvious first try with dry skin. baby oil IS mineral oil. It made my poor baby's face look like someone took a blowtorch to it.) so I was sceptical but desperate and ordered a jar. GOD am I glad I did. None of its components worked alone on my kiddo, so why this stuff works is a mystery. but after two applications my babies skin was soft and all the redness was gone. much like vasaline this stuff will leave babys skin oily, but unlike vasaline it will soak in after about 20 mins. so I give Maddie(baby) a bath and then immediatly after the bath(dont even dry her) while her skin is moist I rub it all over and throw a diaper on. then I just let her hang out in a diaper while the stuff works its magic. this stuff also protects her face from getting chapped in the cold and in a matter of hours will heal any redness she may get from drool sitting on her skin. (teethers drool right through bibs its terrible). I've been using this stuff for a month now. I stopped for a few days and her skin started to revert back to its dry red blotchy state, so I know it was this stuff that worked and not just timing. (pedi said she must have grown out of it. in two nights? yeah right.) I would recomend this stuff to other mothers all day. and adults. its helped my husbands dry cracked feet too!

It not only helps the wound heal faster but, helps prevent pain, as well. Because we were already using this in the diaper area, I started putting a thin layer on the diaper area when there was redness and irritation and this has cleared that all up.

When my two week old got a diaper rash that broke open causing bleeding sores and cracks, (rookie-mom fail!!) the pediatrician recommended this product. Every other zinc based product (Desitin, A+D, Buttpaste) seemed to DRY his skin, making the cracks deeper and nastier. Once we finally got the Doc's recommendation and got the Aquaphor, the rash was bad enough that we battled that particular outbreak for almost a month (combine frequent, slimy newborn poops with lots of wiping and you get a NASTY rash) but Aquaphor eventually won the battle. We saw results after the first application.
Fast forward 5 months and my now 6 month old and 18 month old godson are stricken with a gastroenteritis that results in terrible bouts of diarrhea. Horrendous diaper rash busted out on both tushies. Both babies came home from their sitters with redness spreading across their whole bottom and down their THIGHS! We SLATHERED Aquaphor on the areas and the 18month old was resolved overnight. The infant took an extra day to heal completely.
I use this for everything - I'm like the Dad in My Big Fat Greek Wedding with his Windex! Cradle cap (yes, your LO will look like a greasball, but it will be gone quickly) cuts, scrapes, burns, cracked cuticles or heels, eczema, sore breastfeeding nipples (wipe well before allowing wee one to nurse) and I've even used it on a scratch our dog got out in the yard. Just today I used it to clear up my infant's ""paci-rash"" - those lovely little red bumps on his chin from where his paci sits! This stuff works FAST and KEEPS the affected area healed.

However, whenever I stumble upon super awesome baby product or terribly bad one I feel moral duty to share with my fellow moms and dads who are struggling searching for the best for their baby.
So here is my humble contribution

Before using Aquaphor we used butt paste, for 4 months to be exact. I was going with regular strength for daily use and then whenever rash would come up I would switch to extra strength butt paste. I would also apply some witch hazel, and try to rinse my baby bottom in the sink - like every diaper change - I know that‚Äôs just ridiculous. But the rash would go away and then I would go back using regular strength butt paste, after few days repeat the cycle cause rash would come back. Even if using only extra strength kind rash would still go on and off and warm water treatment was the only solution. So I started to think OK I guess diaper rash is a must, it just comes with the baby? And then....Aquaphor !! No rash whatsoever. 3 weeks straight no rash. Then just to test it out I switched to butt paste...what was I thinking? After 4 days my little one got a rash. I applied Aquaphor that night, the very next morning rash was almost gone. I mean, it‚Äôs just no brainer for me. I also love that this ointment is clear, it doesn‚Äôt leave white marks everywhere like the butt paste. I mean, all our changing pads got stained when using extra strength- so thick it cannot be washed. Also, Amazon the BEST price for Aquaphor. If you buy it with subscribe and save the price is even better. TOUCHDOWN!!! You can stop searching, use next five minutes to get a nap instead. You‚Äôre welcome :)",true,false,

It's like I'm getting the real Aquaphor tub and a cheap trick inside! Not sure who is supplying this but I certainly don't wish to pay $13 for petroleum jelly. I can tell it is not working as effectively on my son's skin as the real Aquaphor. So strange! I've recieved 3 tubs of what appears to be petroleum jelly. I actually used an entire tub to just test it. I can definitely tell it's not the real thing. I am sending back the 2 I just recieved. So weird! Amazon please fix this!

I've been battling stubborn eczema on my index fingers and hand knuckles for at least 12 years! Yes, 12!! I tried all kinds of remedies, and finally settled for using lip balm to keep it at bay, always carrying a small can of it in my pocket and applying to my index fingers and knuckles after every time I washed my hands. If I failed to follow that procedure the skin on my fingers would quickly dry and crack; bleeding would follow within a couple of days; that was very painful and sort of debilitating.
My friend recommended that I should try Aquaphor: wash my hands, apply it on evenings before sleep and cover it with cotton gloves. Results came up in a matter of couple of weeks! My skin got softer, the yellow, callusey spots on my index fingers that were the dry skin patches got smaller and smaller and were soon replaced by pink, healthy looking skin.
I've been using Aquaphor for 3-4 months now and the improvements have become permanent, I am not carrying around the lip balm can any longer. I even stopped using Aquaphor for one month when I was on vacation and I had no problem with dry skin! This ointment is amazing! Highly recommended to everyone with hand aczema!",true,false,

I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt have babies or toddlers, this stuff is amazing on all kinds of skin irritations. One example - I recently moved and am missing my manicurist desperately!! I haven‚Äôt found one that I like nor have I found one that doesn‚Äôt charge an arm and a leg!! Needless to say my feet are looking pretty bad and I got a couple of cracks in my heels. So, before going to bed one night, thought what the heck and I slathered my whole foot, with special attention to my heels, with Aquaphor. I then put on a pair of socks. Woke up the next morning with. The softest feet EVER!!! Cracks were also completely healed.

For another example, I‚Äôd like to use my granddaughters, ages 3 & 2. The 2 year old still wears diapers and the 3 year old is completely potty trained during the day and just about trained through the night. Unfortunately, they both inherited their Mom‚Äôs extremely sensitive skin. So sensitive, that if they have stooled in their diaper, their skin is fire engine red and excoriated within 15 mIn of the diaper remaining on their person. After this occurring one too many times, their parents decided to apply Aquaphor with EVERY diaper change. They have not had a single diaper rash since the oldest granddaughter was a few months old!!! Their parents should take stock out in Aquaphor as much as they use it and go thru it. They can‚Äôt do that‚Äôs where Amazon comes in handy!!! They definitely have the lowest price on the largest quantity and it is worth every single penny!!

We also use it on their pink, wind blown cheeks for fast healing and continuous protection. I‚Äôve used it on my cuticles and I apply it to my lips every night.

It was actually recommended by our pediatrician's office which also supplied me with some coupons to take $$ off the product.

* Apply just enough, don't slobber it over. This stuff is pretty sticky and will make a baby sweat if you cake it on her/him.
* Apply this at nighttime after a bath. Since it tends to get sticky, this stuff will catch lint or dirt if you put it on a baby and let them play during day time. The other option is to keep your house super-duper clean unlike mine and if so, more power to you!
* Use it as a foot cream during winter, apply on washed feet and put on a sock to keep perfect summer-ready toes and heels, at winter time. How cool is that?
* This will not heal dermatitis. If you think it's making any skin rash worse, do not apply. Consult your doctor before you use this over ANY skin rash.
* This is a great lip balm too, try it!

With tubes I felt like I needed both hands to open it and squeeze out the ointment onto my figure while with the tub I can open it with one hand and get some without let going of my child's scrambling legs.

We use this tub religiously to take care of cracked cuticles in the winter, after household maintenance leaves hands rough, and for rough, scaly skin from crawling around the floor at daycare. Notably we do not use it to deal with diaper rash, as you'll want a separate one from a multipurpose tin.

Aquaphor comes out thick and suspiciously slippery, hinting at the formula's potency. For deep healing and moisturizing, dab this stuff on generously and wear a pair of cotton gloves or socks to sleep. The thick compound will linger on your skin for hours, even when rubbed in to the point the top layer of your epidermis ought to be worn off. It carries very little scent to speak of except when concentrated in the tin, and even that has a neutral pleasant quality.

The results speak for themselves. Chapped, reddened skin turns a soft pink. The worst scaly elbows and knees won't stand up to two days of applied care. I've got highly sensitive skin and Aquaphor never generates a reaction for me. Mineral oil and ceresin, the primary two ingredients, are practically inert as far as I'm concerned. The concoction is up for handling eczema and terrible diaper rash right down to soothing a paper cut, and it will hold up through active handwashing with plenty of soap.

Aquaphor is an essential in the home medicine cabinet, and if you're from any kind of cold winter climate, get this. At the risk of sounding like a fan girl, I'll say it makes a huge difference if you have dried skin. Don't suffer in pain when you don't have to.",true,false,

It's a bit like petroleum jelly (think Vaseline) and is quite viscous and even a little sticky. If you need to wash it off, you'd need to wash twice at least.

I would apply it on her forehead once a day and her flaky skin disappeared after a few days to a week. Then I noticed she had flaky skin on the top of her scalp as well so I started putting some on top. It gave her a rather unattractive look of hair grease on top (picture a balding clown) and afterwards, the skin on top actually began flaking off like bits of dandruff but I think it's getting a little better. Hopefully she won't need this hair gel for long...

Well, to sum it all up, in the movie, the father puts toothpaste on everything. Well, I have become that crazy Father because I now put Aquaphor on almost everything!

I bought one of these during Amazon Prime days and wish I bought a full box of them instead. Fear of the diaper rash, put some aquaphor on it! Baby scratches his face and left a red mark, put some aquaphor on it! Diaper band irritation, put some aquaphor on it! Boy baby had a special *snip snip*, put some aquaphor on it! I know I sound like a sham-wow infomercial, but this literally is the magic cream!

Being a first time parent, I didn't realize you had to dry the babies bottom completely before putting on the new diaper. Shortly the baby started developing some irritation. Thank goodness I had this to save me. After ensuring the baby is dry after the diaper change, placing a liberal amount of this on the effected area prevents any future rashes. Furthermore, it can be used also prophylactically (biggest word in my vocabulary so I had to put it somewhere). I have used the other products such as the one shaped as a gluestick, but they don't work as well. Mainly it is due to the fact that you can put a more liberal amount with this tub when needed.

During the past, I always buy the smaller tubes because I thought smaller tubes are better for traveling. There's only one problem with Aquaphor which is very common for ointments: it melts in hot temperature. When I travel to countries with hot weather, one squeeze on the small tube will pump out half an oz of oil. I also have to double zip-bag them during traveling. Because I had to bad luck of buying a half-empty tube once (purchased new with manufacture's seal intact), and repetitive leaky small tubes during traveling in hot weather, I decided to try the large Aquaphor jar. It turns out the big jar has the same Aquaphor that works just as well. Surprise! (wink)

Advice: The other reviews that have said to leave this on their skin for a while so it soaks in a bit are right - leave it there for a few minutes. It will be less sticky and greasy and you'll be able to see a difference once it soaks into the skin. If you have to put clothes on your kid after putting this on, definitely let it soak in first so it's not tugging on their skin as you put a onesie on them.",true,false,

We have used Aquaphor virtually every single day for the past 2 years and have found it to be superior to any other product. Our pediatrician recently gave us a tip to apply the Aquaphor immediately after bath time while his skin is still damp and I feel that's it the only OTC product that legitimately helps with this dry skin.

On the negative side, I will say that it's a bit messy. I don't think my son's clothes have held up too well since we're constantly dressing him on top of a fresh layer of Aquaphor. Same thing with my clothes, as I have gotten some greasy stains from my own hands or from holding him. We also have greasy marks on the walls by his changing table.

If you have a baby with diaper rash, please buy this and apply liberally. It will leave a residue, but that is the point.

This was a life saver, once we started using it on her chin, it went away quick, no rash. My son sucks on his fingers and his hands would get chapped so bad that they would bleed, so we put this on his hands at times he wasn't sleepy and about to suck on his finders and it made a big difference.

The main active ingredient in this is Vaseline / petroleum jelly, but it's also got mineral oil, ceresin, lanolin, panthenol, glycerin and bisabolol. There's something about those extra ingredients that gives it a more silky feel (a little thinner, easier to apply) and better healing properties. It's got a faint mediciny smell like Vick's Vapor Rub (although not nearly as strong).

Highly recommend this stuff. Thankfully we've only needed to apply it to our son once (over a few days). Broke our heart to see him with a diaper rash, but it cleared up in 2-3 days once we started applying this.",false,false,

A thick patch of skin had formed on my upper lip and so far nothing seemed to work to get it to go away. In fact some products actually dried my lips further, which was irritating. The patch was largely my fault. I've been on and off taking care of my lips mostly because I hated wearing anything on them and in general I don't wear makeup anyway. So when the patch showed up it was a wake up call that some habits need to change (like flossing more regularly, too).
So, I bought the Aquaphor. The nice thing about Aquaphor was that I only needed to apply twice, once in the morning and once at night. The moisturization lasts a long time, and I think especially since I live in a humid place although that day I was at work in AC which tends to dry out my lips. Took less than 48 hours then suddenly the rough patch pealed off on its own. I was so thrilled! I decided to try it on a few other akin conditions I had.
A zit that was forming on my chin I put tea tree oil and aquaphor. Tea tree by itself can take 3 days to see results, the aquaphor shaved off a day which was wonderful! Then I used it on my ears which tends to get redness and a little pealing on the back crease, and sometimes in the lobe. I believe it's psoriasis, but I never got it treated by a dermatologist (but then one time I went to one for acne the stuff they prescribed me made me nauseous). Well I put the aquaphor on and the next day I saw results. While there was still pealing, the redness had gone as well as the irritation. The inner lobes are healed up now and it looks like the rest will soon follow (it's day two using it on my ears). I had used a zinc cream before, and I had never gotten these results!
So, overall I'm very satisfied. It's a wonderful alternative to the many creams, lotions, lip balm, lip gloss, and moisturizers over the years. Heck I prescribe to Birchbox and have yet to find anything as effective! I don't even need much, a little really goes a long way and lasts for hours. Next I'll try my scalp and see if it helps with dandruff.",false,false,

His pediatrician suggested to use this ointment on his body . We tried numerous products before this and they did not work on him so i was not very sure about this as well . Also we are very careful on what we use on his skin because we don't want anything to flare it up . As per his doctors suggestion we used Aquaphor twice a day once in the morning and once at night after this bath . Also it is very important that it is applied within 3 minutes after shower as it helps seal natural moisture of the body and does save his skin from drying out . This is the only product that has helped his skin condition. If we use it on him twice a day his eczema is nearly cured. It has worked so well on him that I started using it after I shower and it has made a tremendous difference in my skin. I don't have eczema but in the winter I end up with severe dry skin and this is the only moisturizer that made a difference.

The only downside to this ointment is that it goes on greasy and can take a few minutes for the greasiness to soak in. I prefer not to put on any good clothes right away in case some of the grease transfers to my clothes before it soaks into my skin. If there is a greasy spot or two on the clothing then using powder on the spots helps to get it out (let the powder sit on the greasy spot for a few minutes or more so it soaks up the oils, then brush the powder away).

When we brought him from the hospital he had a small patch of what we were pretty sure was cradle cap. I kept my eye on it and treated it with various different things from olive oil to baby oil to the very expensive Calif. Baby to Selsan blue shampoo, all of which did nothing but make the problem worse. In fact, one day it's like his skin just exploded and the cradle cap became larger, more red and inflamed and he started getting patches of what looked like eczema, on his cheeks, torso and arms. My boy was miserable and not a happy camper. So off to the pediatrician we went. Our pediatrician was dumbfounded and was adamant it wasn't cradle cap and it was ring worm, even despite my telling him it was and he had it since day 1! So he prescribed 3 different kinds of creams, that were pretty harsh. I tried all 3 of them and NOTHING helped. In fact, again, it made the areas worse and seemed to sting my son. I was at a loss and frustrated until I read a post on a baby site that said Aquaphor works wonders. I had my husband rush out and get it and all I can say is WOW! this stuff is definitely a miracle in a jar! First day I applied this to my sons cradle cap on his head within hours the redness went down and it started getting smaller. Day 2 and it was completely gone! It's still working on the eczema on the rest of his body, but he's not as itchy, red or grumpy like he was. He seems way more comfortable. I am pissed I had to fight my pediatrician on this and spend a bunch of money on creams that were harsh and didn't work, but so glad I finally found a cure. I also bought Aquaphor gentle body and shampoo wash and only use that on my sons. It also helps tremendously. Buy it you will not be dissapointed!",false,false,
