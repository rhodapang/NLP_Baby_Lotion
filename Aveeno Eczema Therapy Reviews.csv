I ordered this and nearly instantly felt and saw results. These two pictures are LESS THAN 24 HOURS APART. I've been using it now for 3 days and my face is 100% back to normal.

My husband has extremely sensitive skin and eczema that normally requires medication from the doctor by prescription. I found this here on Amazon, and it has helped both of us so much. His skin has cleared up beyond recognition! He had horrible red, dry skin, but especially on his head, face, back and oh boy, his feet were a mess. He wanted no one to see them! Now, the skin on his back and feet is beautiful, just totally normal and moisturized. Really astounding! No scaling, no cracking. His head took prescription shampoo, and his face took a prescription too, along with CeraVe Eczema Creamy Oil that I also found here on Amazon as well. He uses the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Balm on his body and the CeraVe only on his face.
I can promise you, he was NOT all about putting on all this ""gooey stuff"" and he thought I was just nagging him. üòÇ I was. Lol!
But when he realized the relief and the difference, I don't even need to say anything these days. He just uses it consistently because of what it's done for his skin. The relief is fantastic, no scents, and very calming.
The picture I took shows my finger having dipped some out. I was trying to show you it is soft! Not like Crisco, like so many other solutions out there. It goes on easily and quickly. It takes a little bit to absorb in, but it does absorb; and it feels great. Works wonders for dry and/or aging skin! I have older, dry skin these days (ick!) and no matter what lotion or cream I used before repeatedly on my arms, within minutes they look old and dryed up again. If instead I used the Aveeno Balm, after it absorbs, I am left with soft moisturized skin looking like when I was young and didn't even need lotion on my arms! Wow! Finally!
This stuff has changed our skin issues so much! Beyond worth the cost for such drastic changes for us both. Try it. You'll love it.",true,false,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6197ei+2v7L.jpg

My hands were red, itchy, dry and irritated to the point where the only thing I could do to keep from itching was to tie ice packs on my hands to numb them completely. One particularly cold night I was driving home and I could feel my hands starting to burn and itch underneath my winter gloves. It got so bad that I had to pull over and put on some lotion, which, as usual, did little to remedy the situation. So I stopped at a store hoping to find something that worked and saw Aveeno's Eczema Therapy lotion. I was skeptical because I'd tried other lotions, including over-the-counter ones recommended by medical professionals and even a bottle of lotion that came with my steroid prescription, but experienced little to no clinical benefit (the one that came with my steroid prescription actually made my hands sting and burn even more). I was wary of spending another $12+ on a lotion that turned out to be greasy and ineffective.

But Aveeno freakin' worked!!! My eczema tends to flare during the winter, when my hands are exposed to drastic temperature changes and when I wash my hands too much. As I'm a hopeless germaphobe living in Cleveland, this used to mean that my hands were raw 6 months out of the year. After just a few weeks of using Aveeno, my hands healed completely. Besides whatever specific eczema-soothing ingredients it contains, the reason I think this product works so well is because it provides a good protective barrier for your skin. If I wash my hands within an hour of applying it, I can still feel that the lotion is on there even after I've washed and dried them. But unlike some other lotions recommended for eczema that I've tried, this one absorbs easily and is not at all greasy. It also doesn't have a strong smell - medicinal or otherwise. I use it religiously on my hands year round and as an all over body lotion in the winter or if I've noticed my skin feeling particularly dry and/or itchy.

I may sound a bit overenthusiastic (and no, I don't work for Aveeno), but I'm just happy that I don't have to strap ice packs to my hands any more or feel embarrassed because people are eyeballing my hands while talking to me. If your eczema is driving you nuts, I'd say give it a try.",true,false,,,

I have some patches of eczema and mild psoriasis, both of which are new skin issues, but I've had extremely dry skin for a long time. My dermatologist prescribed me a steroid cream and said to use Vaseline and aquaphor to moisturize. The thought grosses me out - I absolutely can't stand for my skin to feel even the slightest bit tacky. Aquaphor on my elbows, ankles or other rough spots is totally fine, but not all over my body. I needed something to really moisturize and protect my skin without the icky feeling

This Aveeno lotion is pretty thick and I can feel its presence on my skin long after I've applied it. But it stops the itching and flaking and does hydrate my extremely dry skin. It's not sticky and it smoothes on easily, which is a downfall of most lotions and creams that I've tried. It is best after a shower, but it doesn't feel gross if you put it on more than once a day.

I almost forgot - it's great at stopping the itch! Seriously, it calms skin down, it's not just the coolness of the lotion. You really need to try this if you have itchy skin!

This went on for 2 years, and my dermatologist put me on 3 or 4 different creams and/or steroid creams and none worked. I also used at least 10 different natural creams, oils, washes, etc. and NOTHING worked. I even tried fungal creams! Naturally, that didn't work, as it wasn't a fungal rash!

The Eczema Therapy lotion had more and better reviews than the regular Aveeno lotion in a pump (that my family has used religiously for years), and is more expensive too. But I figured it'd be worth a shot because I really wanted to address my shins.

Big mistake. It has the nastiest fishy odor ever. I don't demand my body products to smell heavenly, in fact, I prefer unfragranced lotions so there is less irritation. However once a product starts smelling intentionally BAD, and that makes me smell bad, I draw the line. I tried to use it for a few weeks despite the smell because of its wonderful reviews. The odor did not go away and it didn't do anything for my eczema. In fact, I suspect it made it worse. Every time I applied it to the affected areas, my legs would sting. It didn't give me a rash or allergic reaction, but it irritated my already itchy eczema and didn't do anything to heal it. I started using Lush Sympathy for the Skin‚Äîmuch pricier and more heavily fragranced‚Äîwhich cleared my eczema almost immediately.

For over a decade now, I have been using Aveeno regular lotion plus a squirt of Neutrogena Sesame Oil - mix the two in my palm, and apply. If you are going to try this, do not pre-mix the two together in one bottle. They separate and it just ruins it. So I squirt Aveeno in your palm, then a small squirt of Neutrogena Sesame Oil, rub/mix together with your hands, and apply. I have always had soft skin from this mix.

I am a recent Corona Virus survivor at age 69. During the height of my illness, my muscles ached, my skin was peeling, and almost non-stop itching. I could barely stand any clothing - because everything made my skin itch! Even though I do not actually have Eczema, I reached out to this therapy balm to see if it would bring me some relief. Because all the ""standard"" moisturizing lotions/creams floating around my home were not working.
The answer is YES! I use it primarily right out of the shower and before I go to bed. I use fairly generous amounts which I massage into my torso, legs & arms. And I give it a few minutes to absorb into my skin prior to putting clothes or PJ's on. The RELIEF is fabulous. One of the other things I have noticed is that the moisturizing balm is it is not cold on contact with my skin. That is an added bonus. I highly recommend this product.",true,false,,,

I normally apply this lotion once a day. If I have a rash, I apply it to the affected area to moisturize and provide relief for itchiness and burning.

This lotion is very moisturizing and non-greasy. I try to be light handed because its rich. I have oily skin, so sometimes Ill use it all over my face, and sometimes I just apply the lotion to my t-zone and spread it outwards onto my cheeks.

I pair my lotion with a sunblock.

I suffer from Pachyonychia Congenita (PC). I'll explain what that means at the bottom. But for those of us who have it find it impossible to find anything that helps.
Y'all, this isn't a cure but it works better than anything else I've tried. (Actually, nothing has ever made a difference.) my hands are much less dry. I haven't used it on my feet but maybe I will to see if it helps. You know you just have dry skin in general, right? Well this takes away the ""in general"" part. It feels almost rubbery for a few minutes but then that goes away and it feels like nothing.

As for eczema : you have to use it regularly, but it does work. I use it on my face and one spot on my forehead vanished completely and the rest around my nose/mouth/chin is better but it comes back if I don't use it.

People wondering if they have Pachyonychia Congenita (PC) or just curious about what it is:
It's a gene mutation that is found in one of the keratin genes KRT6A, KRT6B, KRT6C, KRT16 or KRT17. It's thought that less than a thousand people in the WORLD have it, but I think it's much more common- just undiagnosed. Basically our bodies produce too much keratin, but our skin cells are also extremely delicate. The result? Our skin cells easily burst and release all that keratin which turns into calluses and blisters. I don't know ALL the details and I'm not sure which I have yet. I'm waiting on test results. In MY case it affects my hands and feet the most. Some have it worse than I do and some have their nails affected causing super thick nails. Others have a folical thing, but I don't know anything about that. No doctor could tell me what was wrong. I was 33 when I happened upon a YouTube video with my symptoms! So I hope my post helps someone figure out what they have and understand there is no magical product or medicine that can cure you. Most products make it worse. Chemicals are horrible! Certain fabrics are the devil. Most people assume calluses help you not feel pain when you walk. That is a myth. Omg the smallest pebble hurts. Stepping on a vacuum cord practically brings me to my knees. I can't walk without socks, it's too painful and if I try to walk on tile or anything other than carpet I slip. The calluses are so hard and thick they slide on the floor! This is embarrassing and painful. It's splits open and creates these papercut like wounds. Chlorine makes it worse. The beach salt makes it worse. (Not to mention you don't want people to see!) cleaners make it worse and can actually cause a very painful inflammation on your hands that eventually dries out really bad, cracks and hurts and itches. Antibacterial soap can cause this. Do not even think about working with cement or clay (no pottery classes) or glues or paints.... My point? This severely hinders your life in ways most people cannot imagine. Do not make fun of people for their flaws. You have no idea the impact it has on their life and often they have no control over it. I can't just ""use some lotion"" and have soft hands like you. A lot of lotions actually make my hands and feet more dry. The same can be said for anyone suffering from any chronic problems.",true,false,,,

During the summer after my first year of college, I noticed that I had a habit of washing my hands too often during the day. I noticed that because I lived in the dorm for my first year of college, I've developed a germ issue (not the extent of OCD or germophobia, but I washed my hands all the time), which really made my hands dry and irritated. I woke up one morning and there was a distinct, different kind of rash I had on my pinky finger. At first I thought it was just a rash and because I'm someone who had rashes due to dry skin since I was a kid, I thought it was the same type of rash. However, it never went away. After dealing with it for two years, it was still there and it developed into a rash with blisters that would crust and sometimes bleed. It also spread, which is something that never happened to me before. My esteem has never been so low and it was embarrassing and uncomfortable to me since it was on my right hand. I went to the doctor and she told me I had some type of dermatitis, specifically contact dermatitis which is an inflammation on the skin to some allergy that I might have. She said to find out what is causing my skin flare and to stop touching it. She gave me a mild ointment to use to ease the itch. She also told me to use a good lotion of my hands since she noticed that they were a bit dry. I went home and tried to figure out everything that might be causing this, from subway poles to the knives handles, but nothing. As time went on, it also got worst. I was in Rite Aid one day and spotted this lotion and I said to myself, what if it's eczema after all it presented all the symptoms and I bought it on a whim despite the price tag. I decided that if it doesn't work, I can always use this as hand/body lotion. I applied it every night and after a couple of months, whatever that was on my hand is 80%-85% gone. I wish I remembered when I started using this to track my progress, but it was definitely not overnight for me, which shows you what kind of dermatitis I was dealing with. I'm so happy that I found this product and that I decided to make the gamble. It was really one of the best impulse buys of my life. If you have a rash problem, I really recommend this product to try. You've seen how many great reviews this one has so you never know. Good luck.",true,false,,,

I have some seriously dry skin on my hand that has migrated around over 7 years from finger tip to the rest of the finger pads to the palm and back of hand. It becomes rough and flaky at the slightest provocation. Touching fabric used to be a nightmare, my skin would catch on everything, and I lost my finger prints for a while. They've come back as my finger tips improve luckily.

This stuff is decent as a stop-gap. It would be better for people who have only moderately dry skin, not eczema. Its main ingredient is water so it absorbs quickly. The problem for me is that even lotions marketed as being for ""severely dry and cracked skin"" don't help. This stuff is about on that level. It has oats, which are great, and help, but it just doesn't moisturize as well as Triple Cream. On the upside, your hands won't be greasy when you use Aveeno. With Triple Cream, Eucerin and Aquaphor they will be greasy for at least an hour. But that's the only thing that helps my skin :/

I'm going to try the Neosporin Eczema Essentials eventually as well, but I'm not sure how well it will go. Looks like it's about the same as Aveeno.

The result has exceeded our expectations!!

But this product made me change my mind and made me want to write one, just to help out my fellow eczema-afflicted people.

I've had eczema for most of my life; it's not too bad, just a few red patches in the crooks of my elbows and legs and some patches on my face. The ones on my face appeared recently in the last couple of years for some reason. I was always self-conscious about the dry, flaky skin on my face--especially beneath my nose and a patch right on my cheek. It looks horrible with makeup on, but I still always carried around some concealer in my purse/backpack because I'd rather have flaky-looking skin instead of bright-red spots that people would always look at and say, ""Whoa, what happened to you?"" I went through all of the ""treatments"" for eczema--steroids, hydrocortisone, aloe vera gel, lotions, etc. None of them worked. Sure, my eczema will disappear for a few days, but it always came back. I'm pretty sure my skin developed a tolerance for the stuff.
I wasn't too sold on the idea of a lotion magically helping my eczema, but I saw the reviews for it and decided why the hell not. And I'm glad it did. The first few days, it was a little flaky. However, the redness was gone. By the fourth day, all flakiness on my cheek has disappeared and the area looks just as clear as the rest of my face. It's still a little dry below my nose, but it doesn't look as red as before.

Thank you Aveeno, this really is such a great product. I would be devastated if you were to discontinue it.",true,false,,,

After 1 1/2 years in the hospital from a severe MRSA infection of the spine (coma, surgeries) I was left with a skin condition that that made life miserable, - itching,sores and even bleeding. My doctor had told me it was from my hepatitis C (had most of my life) and the damage to my liver I had sustained while ill. I was using every cortisone cream and spray on the market. Short relief...

After a visit with my liver specialist 3 weeks ago, he looked at my skin and said ""Oh, you've got Eczema."" I got on-line to look for eczema treatments, and as I knew Aveeno products were good, I ordered the Aveeno Eczema Cream.

It changed my life!. After a few days of daily use it was all gone, - no itch, sores, nada. I needed a treatment, not a temporary relief.

I've had atopic dermatitis and various treatments all my life and my arms, back, and legs had deep wrinkles and dry patches. The eczema therapy cream decreased the depth of wrinkles, most visible on my arms. At home in Hawaii, I was using another cream, but the wrinkles were pronounced. I've continued using the Aveeno eczema therapy cream and it moisturizes my skin better than previous cream. There are still hills and valleys on my skin, but not as pronounced, and I'm not getting any younger either. My atopic dermatitis has improved somewhat in the last few months, but I can't attribute it to just the cream; my condition is also related to stress and allergies.

Sometimes in combination with steroid/cortisone cream when her skin condition gets worse. However, even with Aveeno cream alone was obviously helping her eczema to be under control(frankly I once thought if this cream contains steroid. I felt this cream worked similar to what steroid does. Works like miracle). We could not live without this cream.

One day after applying out of new package, she started scratching like crazy and ended up having hives. I was wondering why it happens suddenly, why it did not happen until then. Is it because my daughter‚Äôs skin condition then or is it because Aveeno changed the ingredients for the cream? I don‚Äôt know.

OK, now she cannot count on Aveeno Eczema Cream. I had no choice but to search how to fix her eczema or at least to keep her eczema under control without addicting on either steroid or Aveeno Eczema Cream.

I now appreciate this happened. Because her eczema is better now without neither of them. I simply tried the followings.

Changed the diet(Gluten-free, Low carb, Low sugar, Chicken bone soup, etc)
Filtering drinking water
Using laundry detergent to natural
No soap use for body(just rinse w/warm water)
Avoid possible allergens(cat, sun, etc)
Live stress-free
Easy excercise(walking a lot, etc)
Probiotic supplement
Mineral supplement
Unda supplement series

Now I am planning to do ‚ÄúDelayed Allergy Reaction Test‚Äù on her to find out if there is anything(food, mold, etc) that we are not aware and she is reacting to.

Also, knowing the possible causes of eczema such as Leaky gut/Candida overgrowth(GAPS Diet Book explains clearly) helped me open my eyes.

Bottom line. Eczema is terrible to have. I hate it deeply. But she happened to have it and cannot changed the fact. If so, face it and try to study what is really going on the body. Think logically. The key is to systemize for everyday eczema life for less stress on mental and physical.

Hope this helps for those who are struggling.",true,false,,,

It keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and is free of the medicinal smell most other creams have.

I used ""Protopic"" for 1-2 weeks and my skin became normal, then continued Protopic for another week, I quickly switched to Aveeno Eczema for about a month, surprisingly, the condition never came back for years.

One caveat - you have to reapply pretty often during the day (at least I did). That being said, I don't know of a cream that works any other way, so I don't consider this a major drawback.

Before starting my review about this product in particular, I want to share a few observations about this nasty skin condition:

First of all, the best cure for eczema is time... My older child has almost completely grown out of it by the age of three. Now my younger has a big deal of eczema especially prominent in her right hand fourth finger area. I am pretty optimistic no matter how bad it looks at the moment she will be okay within a year or so. This is what pediatricians agree too.

Second best treatment is unfortunately steroids. They are good at suppressing local inflammation which is the cause of eczema. However they have huge adverse effects ranging from the decline in general immunity to total growth suppression and psychiatric problems. Many experts claim that topical administration is innocent but I never feel comfortable so those are out of consideration for me. I can't live with the suspicion of doing a general harm to my child while trying to cure a relatively limited problem.

The best you can do is to avoid over washing the area, moisturize as much as possible and be patient...

If we come to this particular item... I have had it over a month now and bought it mostly due to the good reviews in amazon. Another source I checked before clicking the purchase button was EWG (environmental working group), an agency that classifies skin products based on the ingredients and tell you how harmful it is. According to their evaluation this item gets 2/10 ( lower the better) and is considered to be pretty safe for human use. Therefore, despite not believing the magical therapeutic potential, I still decided to give it a go.

After a month of regular use, I have observed ABSOLUTELY NO improvement in my daughter's eczema. I would give it 5 stars even if I saw a slight change but nothing whatsoever. It may be a good general moisturizer and may prevent eczema or other skin conditions if applied routinely but over an existing eczema it has no healing potential. I don't want to generalize and say it won't work for you since that would not be a scientific claim, but based on my experience and other reviewers complaining about the same inadequacy, I can not recommend the cream as a treatment for moderate to severe eczema.

If you want a better shoot for your money, I suggest trying any of the diaper rash creams that has zinc oxide in it as the active ingredient. I have got some success with those despite not having achieved a full recovery yet...",true,false,,,

She is 17 years old and hasn't had an eczema flare since she was about 10 years old. We went to a doctor and to a dermatologist, and they both just readily prescribed steroid-based creams. After reading the horrible side effects, especially when applied on the eyelid, we definitely sought to find a better solution. We tried aquaphor, Vaseline, pure Argan oil (really expensive!), chinese herbal capsules, unrefined shea butter, organic extra virgin coconut oil----nothing worked! Then we found our perfect combination. I knew that her eczema flare was related to her having seasonal allergies, so she started taking Allegra 180 mg. daily and using Aveeno Eczema Therapy moisturizing cream. I read the reviews for this cream and was really impressed. We were so desperate for a healthy solution, that I decided to give it a try. I am sooooo happy that I did. Within 24 hours, I knew that we had stumbled across a winner! Boy, oh boy, what a major difference in her skin. Can you imagine the turmoil in being a 17 year old high school senior with eyelid eczema? She had swollen, red, itchy, crusty, stretched and wrinkled eyelids with undereye dark circles.

From the first time I used it I saw a huge difference. I have been plagued by two extremely dry, incredibly itchy, red and peeling patches of skin for over two years. I did use Cetaphil Restoraderm and thought it was very good. When I got down to the bottom of the bottle I decided to look around for another product since even though it helped more than other products I had used, I still had the problem. After reading the reviews on Amazon (everybody please take time to write reviews because believe me they are read and relied upon in making product purchases!) I was very impressed even though there were a number of negative reviews, as well. Again, the first time I used it there was a noticeable difference in the amount of dryness even though the area was still pretty red. I expected that though. I used it both morning after a shower and at night. I have used it even a couple of times during the day when I had time. It has only been a couple of weeks and the dryness is considerably better and the skin softer and definitely smoother. Since my skin stays soft the itching has diminished greatly. I cannot recommend this product enough simply because it works. I notice the redness is much less and what is to me the most compelling reason to try it, is that my skin is getting better and better each and every day to the point where it is FINALLY clearing up after suffering with that horrible itch day in and day out for so long. As many of you know, who can sleep when you are so uncomfortable! Now saying all that I really do not like to use any chemicals - especially petroleum - however, I was considering using a cortisone cream and thought this was the lesser of the two 'evils'. I am glad I did since it really is clearing up and I will not have to use it ongoing. I intend to switch at some point to a much more natural alternative, but for now it is doing the job beautifully!

For some reason, my eczema tends to flare up in the summer months rather than the winter months, which has baffled every dermatologist I've seen. Last summer was particularly brutal. Just taking a shower was torture for my hands, and my doctor-prescribed steroid cream was drying my skin out so badly that none of the other recommended lotions could keep up. I ordered this off of Amazon, and was in love from the very first application! I had previously been using a hydrocortisone lotion that claimed to be ""intensively healing"" to eczematous skin, but my hands would continue to burn for up to 20 minutes after applying it, and it really didn't seem to keep my hands moisturized like it claimed it would. This Aveeno cream calmed and soothed my skin on contact, and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day. Within a couple of days, I noticed my skin was starting to heal and my months-long flare up was starting to diminish. I would even recommend this to people without eczema who may just have extremely dry skin. Because it's a cream and not a lotion, it doesn't evaporate from the skin as quickly and actually has a chance to do its job. Because eczema can't be cured, I hope this is a product that remains for years to come. I don't know where I would be without it! Probably contemplating the amputation of my own hands...haha.",false,false,,,

Cracking skin, bleeding wounds - you name it. I couldn't even touch hydrogen peroxide, because it would work its way under and my entire hand would become white and numb!

My doctor prescribed fluocinonide, which helped a little bit, but was expensive for less than 4 oz. But this Aveeno Eczema cream has done wonders - in a matter of two days, my hands felt softer, the cracking diminished so much that I could hardly see it!

It's scaly, itchy, and we can't get him to stop scratching. My mother came down to visit and said that this cream had helped her eczema and that we might want to give it a whirl. Immediately, Kent stopped scratching. It doesn't have a scent, and it's mildly oily. It's not quite as smooth as regular lotion, but it doesn't feel harsh. I thought there's no way this stuff could really be doing anything. A day later, I didn't really anything different on Kent's leg. But we kept applying it, anyway. About a week later the eczema was essentially gone. Only a few little spots were visible. Woo hoo! Once he was ""cured,"" we got out of the habit of applying the lotion, and his eczema returned. We just started using the lotion again, and it's beginning to vanish. In other words, I have no doubts that it's the cream that's working. The bottle says it's safe enough for a baby, and I believe it. It doesn't bother our son at all, and I'm a little relieved that it doesn't have any of those obnoxious scents. A little lotion goes a long way. We've used this lotion for about 3 weeks and we can hardly tell it's been depleted at all.

Yes, it is expensive for a bottle of lotion (we bought it for $12 at CVS), but worth it. If you give it a try, be sure to reserve judgement at least a week. The change is slight the first few days, but noticeable given some time. Also, you can save some cash if you decide to subscribe to it, and I can't brag enough about Amazon subscriptions. My wife and I use subscriptions for toilet paper, paper towels and diapers and save more than even Sam's Club bulk prices on many things (diapers are much cheaper, but Zip Locs are cheaper at Sam's...do your homework to make sure a subscription pays for you). For this lotion, the subscription price makes sense. Unless you've got more than one eczema sufferer, I can't imagine going through one bottle in less than three months, and at $9, the cost of this lotion is negligible. Three bucks a month to wave goodbye to eczema? That's a no-brainer.",false,false,,,

----------------------
I have had eczema for most of my life and except for a bad case as a child, it has been mild, but constant for 30 years. My most recent case was a strip on the back of my knee that was about an inch long and half inch wide that felt and looked like tough old red leather. I have had it for months and using another product, it would not go away.

After two days of using the Aveeno my small strip of eczema is almost gone. Within 12 hours of use it had softened and even began to peel. I love this cream and wish I had discovered it years ago. It is a little pricey, but well worth it. It is far cheaper for me to buy one bottle of the Aveeno than the four or five bottles of another kind that really wasn't working well.",false,false,,,

I have been to the dermatologist 3 times and was told it was 3 different things including sebborheic dermatitis, rosacea and eczema. I have been prescribed Desonide which I slathered on my face for a year not knowing it is harmful and thins your skin. It helped a little, but never made it go away. It also left my cheeks looking weird, pink and like a layer of skin had been removed. I finally went to another dermatologist and was prescribed Ketaconazole and Hydrocortizone (at least this time I was told not to keep using the steroid cream). Every time I used the Ketaconazole, the rash became even worse. The Hydrocortizone helped, but only if I continually used it. As soon as I stopped, it would come right back. This did not help as you're not supposed to keep using it! The third dermatologist prescribed a heavy duty antibiotic, Doxycycline, which made me so nauseous I had to quit taking it. He also prescribed Sulfacetamide which made my cheeks super dry. When I consulted him again, he called in a prescription for Protopic. After reading that it has a black label from the FDA for causing cancer, I never even picked it up. I'm glad I found out BEFORE I wasted my money on it! I have also tried other remedies on my own, which include Derm Essentials, Cetophil cream, Organic Virgin Coconut Oil (which really inflamed my skin), Dandruff shampoo, and Aquaphor. I used to have really nice skin and this rash was driving me crazy.

I came across this cream and thought, what the heck. I have now been using it for 5 days and my face looks better than it has in years. It is really unbelievable to me how well this has worked. As I am writing this, my cheeks are still slightly pink, but the rash is gone and they feel moisturized, not dry. Also, instead of looking like a layer of skin has been removed, it looks like my skin is almost completely healed. I am extremely hopeful that in a couple of weeks, my cheeks will look completely normal again. One thing I do want to mention is sometimes after I put it on and it soaks in, it stings slightly. I wasn't expecting that and was afraid it was going to make it worse, but it continually looked better, not worse. This stuff has been a miracle for me!",false,false,,,

I know it did for me, until I finally realized I am sensitive to Parabens, a very common preservative in the cosmetics industry. I discovered this when I used Cetraben, a brand that solely contains Paraffin and Parabens. I know for a fact I don't react to Paraffin, using Vaseline every day on my hyper sensitive face, so what else could it be? After having had continuous eczema that wouldn't clear up for 6 months, I started to look at my collection of moisturisers more critically. And what did I find? Every single one of them contained Parabens, except for my trusty old Vaseline. I went to the GP and they prescribed me a huge tub of Hydromol. It wasn't exactely what I was looking for because I already knew that Vaseline helped my skin from getting worse (although not healing it either), Hydromol has become a useful (SLS free) soap substitute in the shower so I can avoid the numerous bottles of body wash my and my parner have collected over the years.
HOWEVER, what I was -really- looking for was a Paraben free cream (not an greasy ointment like Vaseline OR Hydromol. I had to wash my clothes practically every day!), so with that in mind I looked around and found Aveeno's paraben free products. Because this particular product (Eczema Therapy) is not available in the UK, I bought their regular moisturiser which also claimed to be good for eczema. I am a sceptical person and don't easily believe the whole ""natural"" fad (even though I am inclined to believe Oatmeal DOES help), I was simply trying to get away from any -possible- irritants my skin could overreact to. And behold... it's been my 3rd day of using the cream, I applied it maybe 3-4 times a day and it's clearing up -amazingly-. I never expected this and was more than ready for another disappointment, but this... I can safely say Aveeno has won me over. The only problem is... this small 100ml tube is almost gone already, after a mere 3 days! Being 7 pound per tube, I am not looking forward to shelling out huge amounts of money for this cream. I'm not a particularly big earner and at this rate I would have to spend 70 quid a month to keep my skin smooth and healthy. Maybe it's worth it, not having to deal with agonizing itching and looking like a diseased person. I'll have to consider this problem.

Bottom line is: RECOMMENDED. PLEASE TRY THIS IF OTHER CREAMS/OINTMENTS/LOTIONS ONLY SEEM TO MAKE YOUR CONDITION WORSE. IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OF PARABENS. :)",false,false,,,

I've had this breakout now for months and have tried even the medicated steroid creams and they did not even give half the result this cream has done in just a few applications.
It's thick enough to not wear off within a few minutes but not too thick to feel uncomfortable.
I would recommend to try and keep your eczema area clear of perfumes and scented soaps, keep as dry as possible and use the cream at least twice a day.
Rub into area well but don't rub till its dry again, you want to keep it moistened.
When applied properly it stays on skin for a few hours visibly but in reality it's still there even if you don't see it you can feel it.

The size of this bottle is really affordable for the price you pay. It should last a few months, of course that depends on how bad your eczema is but mine is just on my hands.

I have mature (over 40), sensitive, acne-prone, congestion-prone, combination skin. But it is less oily in the winter. Earlier last week, I had a nasty allergic reaction to something topical and ended up with contact dermatitis that further evolved into hives. Been taking meds for it but the physical hot flares of hives and discomfort on my legs and arms have been a nuance especially when I am sleeping. I will wake to want to scratch at myself. Thankfully, the flares have been pretty mild but they still itch. I bought a slew of different lotions, balms, medicated creams, and ointments and nothing really took the edge off or hydrated as well as this tub of Aveeno Balm. I absolutely love the texture of the balm version of this as it is thick. Not sure what I can liken it to, but it isn't a lotion or like heavy cream. Nor is it like Vaseline or petroleum. I appreciate glycerine being the first ingredient over water. The slip of this is dense but the application goes on smoothly and is very soothing. I've only used it a couple of times in the last 24 hours since it arrived and it has made a significant difference in my skin. I will be getting this and having it on hand from now on, especially in the winter when the air, and consequently my skin, is drier. It is extremely effective and still gentle. It will absorb into the skin, but I layered it on kinda thick so I had a hint of residue when I went to bed. But I didn't rouse to mindlessly clawing at my legs, so there is that. Who knew oats and glycerine were so healing? I mean, I did but had no idea it would be this nice. It does have a scent, not added. I believe it comes from the oats, which isn't unpleasant or medicinal. Just bland, which is fine with me. I think this would be suitable for use on both body and face, as needed. Affordable.

I was hoping that this would help soothe my hands, but also work for general dry skin woes that I have.

Unfortunately this product is just not for me and my sensitive skin. While my skin is dry, eczema prone and apt for anger, I also find that heavy products make me feel so so so uncomfortable. This balm honestly feels like a glorified vaseline, but way way thicker and clearly far more expensive. Prior to purchase I was optimistic and thought it seemed like a good value, but after trying it out, those thoughts are long gone. This stuff just sat on my skin making it greasier and angrier and I honestly couldn't wait to get it off. It didn't feel like it was moisturizing my skin at all, which I expected given that it had ingredients like ceramides in it. It's also listed as being non-greasy, which I have to say is 1000% not the case. The tub has a cover on it initially and it was also pretty messy to contend with.

It did nothing for my flare-ups and zero for my dry skin. Perhaps if it had, I might have been able to somewhat look past the way it felt. But no, we were 0-2 here and paired with the price, I just can't recommend this. Judging by the reviews, it clearly is a winner for so many, but if you have quite sensitive, dry skin and you don't like heavy/greasy products, I'd suggest that you look elsewhere.

On a general note, I think this might be the last time I try a product from this brand. I've tried numerous Aveeno products over the years and sadly, most of them have caused negative reactions or simply didn't work for me (their hair line was a nightmare for me). They're clearly quite popular, I guess they're just not for me and my skin!

The skin on my index and middle fingers on my right hand, out of nowhere, began peeling and cracking to the point of bleeding last year. It was really painful and didn‚Äôt stop.

I‚Äôve probably spend upwards of $150...and truly nothing worked. I bought the moisturizing gloves, o‚Äôkeefes working hands, literally ALL of the bath and body works hand lotions, neutrogena Norwegian hand cream, Vaseline, puriya wonder balm, steroid cream... i even tried straight olive oil on my hands. That‚Äôs just what I remember off the top of my head. I resorted to using cuticle clippers to clip off the peeling or cracked skin when it would start to fall off or bleed before it would start to catch on things, that‚Äôs how bad it was.

On a whim, I saw this. I figured worse case scenario, I‚Äôve wasted another $7 on something else that doesn‚Äôt work. MY GOD I WAS WRONG. IT IS MIRACULOUS. Within a week, MY HANDS ARE NORMAL. all the peeling skin and cracks are literally gone. They‚Äôre normal hands again!! My friends and family even commented on how much better they look.

I've used steroidal creams to clear it temporarily, but it always comes back. I've used a bunch of moisturizers, and some are OK (O'Keeef's Working Hands, or other stuff with colloidal oatmeal), but none really keep the flaky, raw, red eczema down as well as this stuff. I can put it on and it lasts for a while, and keeps my hands looking basically normal (except for redness). Other moisturizers will work for a very short time, or just not really address the flaking and rawness.

Overall I am super happy I found this stuff. It's making it a lot easier to deal with eczema, making it less uncomfortable, and also letting me be less anxious about it. My hands can look really unappealing when they're super rashy, and it's a little embarrassing, but this cream addresses the rash to a point where I don't really have to worry about it. I apply it through the day and eczema is kept really well at bay.

I just wish there was a smaller size available, the 7.3oz tube is too large to be convenient at all times.",true,false,,,

Recently and after ten years, my hands began to crack again as I moved to a colder place.

- Hydrocortisone 1% cream
- Moisturising creams, all sorts of brands
- Dead sea mud mask
- Moisturising mask left overnight
- Steam facial done by professional aesthetician

Everything I've tried from the above has either helped only a little if not none whatsoever. Figured let's Google some of the best eczema creams out there with natural ingredients and give it a shot.

I did not want to use anything with steroids on my eye, especially since that can thin your skin. I tried this Aveeno and by the next day, there was improvement. I was still holding my breath though, hoping it would continue since sometimes it can get better then worse again. I am happy to report, it continued to improve and after 2 weeks of use, I feel fairly confident that it is quite healed. I will keep putting it on once every night at least to make sure the eczema stays away. When I first used it, I was putting it on 4-5 times a day.

EDIT: 6/7/18 STILL THE BEST
Out of anything I've tried, this has been the best for the eczema I have on my hands. It helps so much when my hands are feeling dry. When my hands are dry, they start cracking and itching which leads and I frantically search for my tube of Aveeno Eczema therapy like it's a drug. It's the only thing that brings some sort of relief. I love the texture. It's not oily, but it also doesn't just disappear in a few seconds. It really moisturizes your skin.
As for the times when I have a really bad flare up and the bumps start appearing and causing pain and severe itching, this lotion doesn't make the pain go away. It really is for more addressing the dryness and mild itchiness that arises from the dryness. Also good for preventing skin cracking. I literally can't go a day without it.

Fast forward to Sept. 2013 and I've tried hydrocortisone 2.5%, eucerin lotion for very dry skin, blah blah blah. While the hydrocortisone worked for a bit my body did build up a tolerance. The eucerin worked ok for a while but was too greasy and made my skin redder. For the past month or so my ezcema hasn't been itchy so much as red and flaky. Don't get me wrong it itches now and then, but not like in the beginning. Anyway I wanted to try something natural so I tried this stuff... At first it actually irritated my skin a bit. It actually made it a little itchy. It was itchy for about 10-15 minutes. It did feel better afterward, though. I continued using it because I know I'm not allergic to oatmeal and I believe my body must've just been adjusting to this new treatment. I've been using it for over a week now and the redness is going away and it seems to be helping about as much as the hydrocortisone, except without all the steroid crap...

The lanolin caused such a bad reaction that I had eczema all over my legs, torso, back, and the inside of my arms. I don't like to use the steroids long-term because it thins the skin. Yet when using this Aveeno product alone, my eczema was kept nearly all away. I have to apply it twice a day, though, so it is quickly disappearing. If I only put it on in the mornings, my skin gets dry and itchy by the late afternoon. I have almost used it up within two weeks, and it would be expensive to order so much of it.

The lotion coats your hands with almost an oil so I thought for sure this would be a product that worked. I at first used the product three times a day, once in the morning, once after work, and once before bed and some of the spots stayed consistent instead of getting worse. I was hopeful, but all it did was maintain it did not improve. Also, applying the lotion 3x a day isn't feasible because your hands are so greasy that anything you touch becomes grimy. I am still using it every night before bed just because it does adhere well to your hands, so I have a lotion on my hands before bed but I am actively looking for another product.

I was skeptical about this type of Aveeno lotion, since I couldn‚Äôt see a difference in the ingredients that would help treat Eczema until I noticed most of the Aveeno lotions list dimethicone as the active ingredient and not colloidal oatmeal (which is the active ingredient in their Eczema treatment formula). I‚Äôve been using this for about a week and it has helped with my skin, although it is not a magical cure. It tends to sooth the afflicted skin upon contact. I used it in conjunction with MG271 and found the Aveeno to smell better and was easier to use, not to mention doesn‚Äôt stain clothes. The only complaint I have is the Aveeno is expensive!

Again, she complained it stung, but it only stung for a bit and the rash got even better.

No pimples or any other issues. But February of last year I spotted a small light pink patch on my the left side of my face. Didn't pay much attention to it and after a few months it become worse and the parch become bigger, red and inflamed.

Visited a dermatologist who prescribed Momate cream and a moisturizing lotion. I used it for several months (every other day). It helped reduce the redness a lot but the light pink patch always existed and it would cause breakouts. If I would stop using it for a few days it would become worse. It also left the skin looking very white and thin / flat. At the time I had no idea about steroid creams and how harmful they are.

I stopped using Momate cream immediately and after a few days the skin flared up very bad. All of the left side of my face (cheek) had become very red. It didn't itch.

After searching the net, I found Aveeno Eczema therapy moisturizing cream was the most effective. I've been using it for 20 days and the redness has reduced about 80%. There's a noticeable difference everyday. It was dark red and now It is light pink.

The first few days it made my skin very dry / flaky, tight and more red (when the cream was washed off). Maybe that is it's way to get rid of the irritated skin. The dryness continued but it kept on reducing, so did the redness and the slight swelling. The tightness has totally gone now and there's very mild dryness.

Every winter I get an eczema flare up. It used to pop up in small patches on my arms but in recent years it has progressed to large, ashy, cracking, incredibly itchy patches on my elbows and between my fingers. Doctors I've seen believe it is caused by wearing long sleeved jackets, sweaters, gloves etc. in the winter and thought it was caused by irritation from fabric. Here's what I have tried with limited success: hydro-cortisone cream, aloe vera, prescription steroid creams, oral anti-histamine, topical anti-histamine, oatmeal baths, bandages to limit skin contact with fabric, tons of OTC moisturizers, oils, petroleum gel as a barrier.

I was miserable. I'd spend all day feeling like my elbows were on fire, sometimes with itchiness and sometimes with pain. They would crack, bleed, looked disgusting, and there was just no way I could walk around in the winter without a jacket. I was waiting on a dermatologist referral when I decided to try this product. As soon as I applied it, I felt relief and actually said ""Ahhh"" out loud. I applied it many times a day for the first couple of days (I was just that itchy) and soon felt less need to apply it. After 2 weeks or so my elbows and hands looked completely normal and were no longer itchy at all. I cancelled my dermatologist appointment and switched to using the cream once every few days just as a preventative measure. My eczema stayed away for the rest of the winter, I couldn't believe it! Off all the things I've tried, this cream was the first one to bring relief and help my skin return to normal. Now I can't live without it and still use it once in awhile even in the summer if I notice a dry or itchy spot anywhere on my body.",true,false,,,

While this is highly moisturizing, I don't feel that it absorbs fully into your skin - often leaving a tacky layer on top. The scent also tends to linger a little bit and can change if you go out in the heat or do any sort of activity, making this not a good option for summertime use or for use with workouts.
Overall, this is a good option for reducing the number of chemicals being put onto your skin, something that is a good first step for those with skin sensitivities. This does a great job at moisturizing but can tend to be sticky.

However, I am skeptical of reviews about treatments and medicines because testimonies are not proof, they are just personal experiences, and reviewers are typically not scientists and have no statistical data to back up their claims. Here is my view of this product and why I dislike it:

I recently noticed that the Avenno Baby Eczema Therapy moisturizing cream went up in price sharply in the retail stores. The price at Walmart is now about $9 for 5 oz. My son's doctor has repeatedly said this is the only cream my son, who suffers of eczema, should use, but is that true? Is this product really all that special? Are there alternatives that perhaps cost less and are perhaps even more natural?

Looking at the Avenno Eczema Therapy label, the only active ingredient is ""colloidal oatmeal"". If you don't believe me, check it out in their own page in the ingredients section.

So what is colloidal oatmeal? Let's see, according to Wikipedia, a colloid is ""a mixture in which one substance of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance"". Wow, isn't that common. Here are some examples of colloids ...

soda pop
whipped cream
beaten egg whites
milk
mayonnaise
lotion
Gels
gelatin
butter
jelly
Sols
ink
rubber
liquid detergent
shampoo

You can google ""examples of colloids"" if you'd like to verify this. Seriously? A colloid is nothing special. So then what is ""colloidal oatmeal""? A little bit of googling for ""can I make colloidal oatmeal at home"" brings up a bunch of articles that make a lot of sense. Here is an example from Dermnet: ""Colloidal oatmeal is a finely ground form of oatmeal that readily absorbs water. It can be prepared by using a food processor, blender or coffee grinder"". Wow, so colloidal oatmeal is simply oatmeal flour with water!

Let's take a look at the other ""unique"" ingredients in the Avenno Baby Eczema cream. According their own label, ALL of the other ingredients in the cream are inactive ingredients, as follows: water, glycerin, panthenol, distearyldimonium chloride, petrolatum, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, avena sativa (oat) kernel oil, steareth-20, benzalkonium chloride, ceramide NP, sodium chloride, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract.

So... it also has oat kernel oil and extract, but they recognize this is an inactive ingredient, meaning, it is not a medicine. The rest of those inactive ingredients are common ingredients in most skin creams.

My conclusion is, this cream is not that special, and I would be able to help my son better by making colloidal oatmeal at home.

It's not only soothing for my raw skin, but somehow it actually helps to heal it.

In case you didn't know, regular steroid use can damage your skin and actually make it more vulnerable to allergic reactions and eczema.

I moved to the US last November and temperatures where I live have reached -20C (-4F) which made my face more upset with me. I went out and bought Cerave moisturiser and at first it was... okay. It was a little thin, but it seemed to keep everything at bay.

Recently the hot, humid weather of summer has hit us and my skin weirdly reacted to it with a vengeance. This has never happened to me in the summer before, but it was just so painful and the Cerave stung so much while having no effect that I knew I would have to change products.

First, I bought a small tube of regular Aveeno daily moisturiser and would apply it to the worst parts of my face on top of the Cerave. If anything, this seemed to make my skin extra angry, though I fruitlessly continued, hoping it was just taking its time to react. After a month, I conceded defeat.

I researched my condition properly and realised I most likely had something called perioral eczema. I googled pictures of it and it was like looking at my own face. Armed with this self-diagnosis (don't judge), I started researching over the counter cures because I don't want to use steroids. What I saw mentioned a lot was Cerave (-_-) but then I came across a blog posting of a woman who used the Aveeno eczema therapy cream and the Aveeno baby bath wash/shampoo. I ran out to Walmart and bought them both despite the $11 price tag on the cream. Seeing that it's $17ish here, I would recommend buying it from Walmart if at all possible.

As soon as I got home, I washed and moisturised my face with these products. The results were immediate. I mean yeah, the red skin was still there, but it felt so much calmer. The stinging and itching all but vanished. I did get some itchiness a couple of hours later, but applying a little more cream helped immensely.

I have continued to wash and moisturise my face twice a day and my eczema is now gone! I didn't even know my facial skin had the ability to be so smooth. Even my husband has been impressed with the dramatic improvements since he has been so used to seeing me look like I partake in rubbing sandpaper on my chin.

One word of caution: The moisturiser goes a long way. I squeeze out maybe an inch to an inch and a half of product and rub it into my entire face. Anymore than that and you'll become an oil slick immediately. Your face will become oily as the day goes on, but if you just wash it off and apply another coat after, it'll help. I'd rather be a little oily than how I was before, anyway.

I would recommend this to anyone with facial eczema who has not tried this yet. It won't work for everyone, just like Cerave doesn't work for me but works with many others.

Edit: Unfortunately I have had to downgrade this review from 5 to 4 stars. While it does a good job moisturising the normal parts of my face, as the summer went on and the cold snap of autumn has arrived, my eczema has come back with a vengeance and now this cream and the baby wash do nothing for me. My face is worse than it has ever been before. I don't blame the Aveeno products, I think maybe it's something in my diet. I just wanted to come back and warn that this isn't a miracle product, you will need to find out what is actually causing your eczema; this will just relieve the feeling of itching and pain.",false,false,,,

The redness vanished entirely, itching stopped, and the skin was less dry (though still a bit dry as evidence by some white, flaking skin that remained). Since the dryness I experience is due to pulling gloves on and off, I think this was about as good a result as I could expect and I was satisfied with its performance.

In terms of scent, this doesn't have much of one and isn't perfumey. It goes on smoothly and absorbs well. I didn't experience any greasy residue afterwards.

I went to the hospital as usual and got a shot and a week of pills. But after that week, it came back again. It disappears for two days and reappear for 2 days for about a month, and suddenly it got worse that I could not stand it anymore. I went to the allergy clinic and got a blood test for allergy.

When Amazon offered me a tube of Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, I figured what did I have to lose. I had never tried a product specifically labeled for eczema before. I expected that I would apply it for two or three days and come back to report the results. I was not very hopeful, as I have never had much luck with regular moisturizers, even expensive ones.

What a pleasant surprise! After only one application I could see and feel the difference the next day. Flaking and itching have all but disappeared and the redness I associate with this patch of eczema is gone. After two days, the results were even more dramatic.

A couple times a year I get quite bad eczema on my cheeks going up to my ears and down to my neck to the point I've been stared at and told I look diseased. Coupled with anxiety the duo would often be enough to shelter home and cancel everything until my skin cleared.

I was skeptical at first, fearful even seeing as every single other product and lotion I have tried would burn horribly. But I took the chance and am so happy I did. Instantly my skin felt relieved. And by that evening it already began to fade. It's been 2 days and it's almost gone! Normally this would be a 1-2 week ordeal but this stuff really does work magic.

That being said I find that it should be reserved for the times when I've forgotten about a spot or something in particular has flared up due to its price. Eczema for me is more about proper management, and this means application of lotion twice a day. It hasn't mattered too much what type of lotion I put on my body, so long as I remember to do it.

This cream does work around the eyes, but it eventually bleeds into my eye and causes me to tear. For eyes I recommend Radiance eye cream with royal jelly from Burt's Bees. Very very expensive, but you only use tiny amounts around your eyes and it will last two people for quite a long time. I'm guessing I would need to buy two of them per year.

I bought two creams at Walgreens ($13.64ish) only because they had a deal on two and I had a coupon for two, so it worked out for me. But when I run out, I will most likely purchase from Amazon.

Onto the product. This is really great! I am currently 23 years old, and I have had skin issues for (what it seems) all my life. When I was younger the doctors described it as rashes, so on that went. Then in my teenage years I was told it was Eczema. Now in my 20s I'm told by my doctor and a dermatologist that I have both Eczema and Psoriasis. Fabulous. At least now they've narrowed it down. I started getting signs of Eczema in new areas and it worried me, so along with recommendations from my dermatologist, I researched and found this as a solution that worked for many online. I wasn't extremely comfortable applying steroid cream to my eyelids and face, so I tried this out, and it has truly helped me out. Now the issues haven't disappeared, and since I am African American discoloration will apparently stay with me for years to come, but the roughness and apparent obviousness of the issues I had on my forehead, cheek and eyelids have diminished at a great capacity. So this cream is one that I apply to both my face and on my hands. I get dry hands easily and therefore have several places on my hands that are issues for me (which is why I always carried lotion in each bag and in my pockets if I could), and although I haven't seen the same result on my hands that i have of my face, I will not give up. I just love that after I apply this to my hands, they look and feel moisturized. I find that with some lotions after I apply them to my hands, they still look dry. It would get on my nerves! But I don't have that issue with this lotion.

This lotion is amazing, and although I have used Aveeno previously for years at different times, I never knew of this version. Too bad this is the largest size, but this is already one of the most expensive products from the line, so I can only imagine how much that would cost.

And then after my skin got mostly cleared up, I started applying the Aveeno lotion at least once a day, sometimes twice, and I haven't had any eczema breakouts since!

For my face, Pond's dry skin cream works (the blue one) but for the front of my neck, the dry skin can get really bad & start to feel really dry and rough within a matter of minutes after stepping out of the shower. My other lotions don't work for my neck, but this lotion does & I'm glad I bought it. Sometimes I have to apply it 3-4x before the dryness goes away, but it eventually does. Sometimes I forget to apply it before going out & then by the time I get home, my skin's already started flaking off. This lotion's the best I've found so far for this random patch of dry skin.",false,false,,,

I have some kind of eczema reaction from using dish soaps on the back of my hands. I have never been diagnosed because mine is very mild. It's just extremely dry, scaly, and rarely cracks and bleeds. They used to offer this same thing but in their Baby Care line. I used that entire bottle and then I found this, which is the exact same thing with oatmeal extract. It's the only cream that has ever really soothed my skin and made it feel soft and comfortable again.
The consistency isn't too thick. And once it's absorbed, it helps the relieve pain from the worst areas that have cracked. Basically makes the obvious signs of scaling or drying vanish the same day.
The next best thing would be straight neosporin, but that stuff is so greasy and unpleasant, and you really dont want to rub it everywhere because then it will not absorb and just transfer to everything else. So to really cure my hands I use this all over and then neosporin over bad spots and using bandaids for one night/day. Then it's all better by the next day.
Just have to switch to a milder hand soap, or wear disposable gloves more often.
I don't think this stuff smells like anything special but that's a good thing. When your skin is irritated, the last thing you should do is put an unnecessary fragrance on it, that's only going to make it worse.
