It is fragrance-free, paraben-free, and phthalate-free. The consistency is thicker than a lotion... kind of like vaseline thickness, but not so greasy and sticky. It absorbs quickly and definitely moisturizes!!

Nothing seems to soothe irritated skin better, except pure petrolatum, which is too greasy to wear under makeup, for example--and CeraVe has ceramides, and I understand other ingredients, that rebuild and maintain your skin's barrier function even better than petrolatum. You can buy smaller tubes of the cream, since the big tub is, well, a big tub, and tubes are more portable, but this is probably more cost effective. It's not exactly the same formula, but it seems to have the same ceramides and most of the same ingredients but in different places in the list. I think it seems to be even richer, and makes a perfect hand cream--it has the same texture as the Aveda hand cream my salon has out, without any of the irritants.
For baby use, the tub of the original cream would be great for the changing table or bathroom counter, but this is way easier to tote, and neater!",false,true,

The best, most effective applications are taking it: after shower/bath, for deep moisturizing especially in dry environments (dry climate, winter, or air-conditioned/heated rooms/spaces/quarters), and against dry skin in general on daily basis maybe before sleeping. After the first use, the dry skin hydration increased the next morning resulting in a visible improvement in the skin smoothness and softness. However, the cream made the skin min. more delicate that might have been an unavoidable byproduct of its increased softness. For the same reason, the skin became min. more sensitive to touch and prone to scratch, but - at the same time - faster healing for its increased moist, as under a Band-Aid.
