RRPK6U0JJ12O2," Worked wonders on my toddler eczema. Highly recommended!",Kimberly Sue,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGRKMQT4MDQFSY64PB4UIHXWFYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"April 15, 2017","My 3, almost 4, year old son has had eczema since he was around 8 months old, and at times it can get really bad. I have a ointment that I use on the bad spots, but I don't like to use it all over his body. I did a lot of research trying to find a lotion that I felt would work best on his sensitive skin. I knew that cetaphil was a great brand for sensitive skin, so I was already partial to it, and I decided to stick with what I know. Within one day of using the lotion on him, his skin was looking better. The issue I always had with the ointment was that it was so sticky, and that his skin never felt smooth and soft, like a toddlers skin is supposed to feel like. However, after using this lotion regularly, his skin has quickly begun to feel soft and smooth. His back no longer feels rough and dry, and he doesn't have the big patch of red, scabby skin behind his knee that drove him crazy no matter how much ointment I put on it. I don't know why doctor's never told me to get lotion like this for him? They did suggest Aquaphor initially, but it did not work, and it was really sticky. This lotion soaks into his skin and makes it soft. He was so excited to be able to put lotion on like his brother (he's an identical twin). I never let he use the same lotion as his brother, but now he has his own ""special"" lotion, and he loves it and reminds me to put it on all the time! I definitely recommend it for mother's who have younger children with eczema. It says 'baby' on the bottle, but it works great for my toddler!",true,false,

THE WASH IS NOT TEAR FREE..
1st time we used the wash i about chucked it out the window.. immediately made my son cry in pain.., he screamed for 5 minutes after we got him rinsed off, it may have gotten in his eyes, we were so fixated on his cries of pain.. I assume yes.. but on a side note bc we were so worried about rinsing and calming him we omitted our normal lotion after bath treatment.. the next day we did notice a change in his facial eczema rash.. this wash did show improvement to the rash however not worth the tears üò¢.. 0 star
onto the lotion.. we tried the lotion just bc it wasn't likely to get in his eyes and cause the same reaction.. as I apply a thin layer to an area needing it on his leg.. it too seemed to burn him.. as he started rubbing at the area I just applied it too and would wiggle and moan out in discomfort and started scratching immediately üò¢ again 0 star

While the container is relatively small, it makes sense to me since this is intended for infants and (in most cases) will be applied sparingly and to specific, afflicted areas.

The contents are of a medium consistency, but rapidly work into skin (especially if one warms it in one's hands before applying to baby). If applied correctly, it should not be sticky/tacky. (However, I once applied over-zealously and it was definitely tacky ... directly as a result of my overuse though). Likewise, there is virtually no scent/fragrance.
