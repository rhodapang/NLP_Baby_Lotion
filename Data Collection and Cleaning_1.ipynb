My eyes were completely swollen shut and red, my face was peeling, in pain, inflamed and DRY DRY DRY. I tried everything and I mean everything.  I ordered this and nearly instantly felt and saw results. These two pictures are LESS THAN 24 HOURS APART. I've been using it now for 3 days and my face is 100% back to normal. I really like that this product is a cream versus a lotion, I feel it helps soak in better and KEEPS the skin hydrated. 100% recommend.\\n\""
