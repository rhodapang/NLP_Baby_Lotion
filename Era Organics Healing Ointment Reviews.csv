When I say dry, I mean horrible, thick, insane dry patches on tops of her feet. The doctor said to try vitamin E, we were trying coconut oil, neither really made a difference that we could see, then... we tried this stuff. One thing I can say first and foremost, keep using it consistently, don't give up because it's messy, or the baby doesn't want to sit still or you think it isn't working well enough in a few days. Use it every time you change a diaper, after a bath or just when you notice it's rubbed off. At first we put it on very thick and then loosely wrapped some gauze and then put socks or pants on to keep it in place. Do this for about 3 days, you will start to see improvement, it might not be a significant difference, but you will. After that just keep using it, and little by little it will get better. As it starts really healing the skin will be very itchy, so your little one might need your help. Our little one kept sliding her ankle and foot around on the floor which was bad if she was not covered because she would rub her skin raw, so we had to keep socks on her all day and then let her skin breathe at night while she was sleeping. I have to say after daily use, this stuff has made a huge difference in our little girls skin condition and has helped her heal and feel comfortable and normal again. It's very difficult to watch your little one suffer with something like this, but thanks to this wonderful ointment, we are all feeling better and our little one seems happy again.

R34GUUDZMKR31K," It's helping my baby eczema",Rewjet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJW62LZMOIRFPBN2JKHGQJNJVTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,5,"January 31, 2021","I have two daughters. I tried several expensive and popular creams (Evereden, Mustela, Pipette, Eucerine, Aveeno, you name it) God knows how much money I spent trying different products. This is the only safe ointment that didn't cause a burning/redness reaction on my baby's sensitive skin. I have eczema so naturally, my baby has the same. Between her cradle cap (dermatitis seborrheic), the baby acne, and eczema I was completely overwhelmed trying several products. Many of them helped on the cradle cap but triggered eczema so I just want to share that many products can help on something but make things worse in other babies' skin areas.

This ointment helped specifically on my baby's atopic dermatitis (a type of eczema), her legs were like leather, dry and itchy so what I am doing is after each bath with lukewarm water + baby wash foam (fragrance-free / no harsh soaps) I apply this ointment immediately on her body within 3 min to lock moisture. It really made a difference and my baby's eczema, now her legs are softer. I am still using it, so once I finalize the treatment I will update this review with pictures. Also, I saw a negative review about the ointment has a grainy texture, but that is how to suppose be since 99% of ingredients are oils and beeswax, you need to melt the ointment in your hands first to spread it smoothly on the skin. I guess the product description should mention that, but if you struggle with the application do this and you will notice the difference.

Note: This ointment didn't work on my baby cradle cap (dermatitis seborrheic) ONLY worked in her eczema / atopic dermatitis. It's important to understand that those conditions are different. The cradle cap is an excess of sebum so adding more oil can soften the yellow crust and flakes but doesn't clear it. At least that's my experience after my research.",true,false,,

I've had it for almost 5 most and here's a list of things I've tried to use it for and their results:
Cradle cap on daughter's eyebrows: this seems to be the only thing this balm was very effective for as it eliminated it and it hasn't returned.
Cradle cap on head: I do NOT recommend putting this on your baby's head if he/she was born with a lot of hair! My daughter was born with a lot of hair, shes almost 6 months old and and the hair on top of her head is pretty long. I put this stuff on her head and combed it through and it left the most awful residue imaginable on her hair. It looked like I dipped her in cooking grease and after 2 shampoos, It still wont come out. On the plus side, Her hair is so greasy, you cant see if there's any cradle cap left, maybe?
Diaper rash: this actually gave my daughter a diaper rash after I tried using it as a rash preventative.
Eczema: did not help with eczema and it made her break out on areas where she wasn't having an active rash.
Rash in general: nope. Didnt do anything.

I wish had had as much luck as other reviewers did.
Edit: it took 4 washes to get this stuff off my daughter's hair and once all product was washed off, her cradle cap looked the same as it did before.",true,false,,

But I put it on my wish list for “just in case,” while I used babyganics every day infant lotion, a cleansing oil for cradle cap & my go-to for skin issues, vitamin e oil. Then her rash got worse & she developed a drool rash on her chest. By then the 4oz jar was no longer available & I still didn’t want to commit to a $15 jar of something I’d never used or heard of before. I bought something else (cheaper) that was supposed to be great for rashes & non-burning. It arrived, I put it on my baby not thinking anything would happen & she screamed like the dickens (bc it prob did burn 😞).

Then I bought this. It was back ordered & I anxiously waited for it to arrive; it finally came several days ago. I slathered it on after her bath & the very next day the cradle cap on her face improved. I bathe her every other day so as not to dry out her skin, so I skipped a day - then forgot after her next bath. I didn’t even realize until just before writing this review that the cradle cap on her face was almost all gone. It’s only still very mildly on one cheek (but she rubs her face a lot & especially rubbed that cheek after I put it on). So I only used it ONE time & it cleared up her facial cradle cap & chesty drool rash. It also has a semi-cocoa kind of smell (reminds me of a chocolate scratch & sniff sticker). And I know it doesn’t burn bc she didn’t cry at all when applying — & she is SUPER fussy. I didn’t like spending so much on something I wasn’t “sure” of, but this stuff is absolutely worth it bc it actually works (when many others failed). I’ll be back to buy the diaper balm, plus lotions for eczema for my older kids.",true,false,,

I was eager to try it after doing lengthy research about what things to look for in an ointment/salve for baby eczema. This one pretty much had all of them! It smells wonderful - like chocolate (due to cocoa butter being one of the ingredients). It goes on quite greasy (which is to expected with the different oils and such that are in it), but absorbs into the skin in only a few minutes. A little bit goes a long way too - which is nice, since this balm is a bit pricey (as it should be for all organic, natural ingredients!) The only reason I’m rating it as 4 stars instead of 5, is because unfortunately it has not cleared up my baby’s eczema. I’m so sad about it! I feel like if there was anything out there that would’ve been able to aid in healing (besides steroid creams, chemicals, etc. that I want to avoid for his delicate skin), then this would’ve been it. At least for now I can say that with applying it 3-4 times per day, it has not gotten any worse - which for now I’ll take! And I wonder if there may be more internal factors affecting it that external remedies wouldn’t help anyway - (dairy sensitivity possibly?? I digress.) And the dry skin on my own hands is banished!

Let it sit then we got into a warm shower and I used the Safety First brand cradle cap comb to massage her scalp and scrape the flakes off.

It left her hair kind of greasy for the next day but I didn’t bother with it bc I figured I’d let the oils soak in to get rid of any remaining flakes I may have missed, then the day after I washed and combed her hair again just for good measure and it was soft silky and cradle cap free.

1) Good customer service - I received my jar damaged, they expedited shipping and sent me a new one.
2) this cream really works. Don't expect it to be a miracle cream that will heal your baby's skin after one apply. It takes some time. My son has mild eczema, very bad acne/rashes under the chin, folds and behind the ear due to acid in the spitup, and some mild cradle cap on eyebrows area and ear. It took about 2-3 days to clear up the eczema, I see obvious improvement in spitup areas within a day, cradle cap area was improved with in 1-2 days. My point is this product really works you need to give it sometime. I literally apply this every time after I change his diaper.

When I feel his eczema area was really dry, I use it after Cetaphil moisuring lotion. That lotion is not sticky and easy to obsorb. Then I seal it with healing balm.",true,false,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719ruVb8b4L.jpg

Our doctor gave us a prescription to use on the patch of skin near her ear, but it didn’t work (not to mention it made it incredibly red and “angry” looking), so I quickly returned to using this instead. The spot hasn’t totally gone away, but the redness and dryness has reduced significantly, and I honestly feel much better using this than a prescription cream on my baby girl’s skin.

I can’t speak highly enough of my experience with this product; I would order it by the gallon if I could.

The pediatrician said nothing would work except steroids and she'd be on and off them for years to keep it under control. He said if she was older she'd be on pain relievers and Benadryl too.
I decided to try this Era Organics balm instead first and if it didn't work we'd give the steroids a go. This product worked to reduce the swelling in 24 hours. I lathered it on every couple hours and the next morning the inflammation was way down. We've been using it for one week and her eczema is very minor now. I would highly recommend!
UPDATE: I started giving our daughter an infant probiotic shortly after posting this review and WOW eczema gone!

I was frustrated and wanted to make good on the 60 day refund policy before time was up. The guy that emailed me back was so nice and said that, because it actually balances the ph of the skin, sometimes it seems to get worse before it gets better. He said he was happy to give me a refund right then, but asked if I would be willing just give it a few more weeks and, if it still wasnt better, he'd give me a refund at any point. He sounded so confident in the product that I agreed and, sure enough, in about 1 more week, all of his patches cleared up and have stayed gone for the last 3 months.

No joke, it is a miracle worker! My 10-month old son was suffering from an extreme case of eczema and it was to the point where he would scratch so badly that he would rip his skin open. I was trying everything I could think of; then I came across this product on Amazon. I thought, why not? It couldn't hurt to try. I wish I would have taken a before picture and a current picture to show how much it has improved. In all seriousness, within a week his skin was almost back to normal. The only ""problem"" areas now are his hands and a couple on his back..both of which have healed up significantly. Before the eczema spots were all over. I highly recommend this product 100%. A little truly goes a long way, I'm only about half way through the jar.

I also have to say, the owner of Era Organics is amazing. I love when a company sends you an emailing thanking you for purchasing their product.

My intention is not to offend anyone with the title, however, I have to be careful of the products I use on my son's hair simply because of the drying issues many african-(american) mothers deal with when it comes applying products on their child's scalp/hair. I have cautiously tried quite a few products and this one so far is the best. It treats his scalp while not drying out his actual hair. I message this product onto my son's scalp sparingly because it's pretty thick, too much will clump up his hair. In my opinion, it is worth the price. Now after I have been using this product for some time now, I don't have to apply it every day.

I'm telling you this stuff works. I only used it once but I've never seen her problem areas look this good except when she was born. Now I may update this later if it doesn't continue working but you just had to know that this little miracle salve worked in the first usage.

I didn't really notice a smell but I will say that I was concerned looking at how thick and waxy it looked in the jar. Once I scooped some out though it became so wonderfully creamy I wished I could use it on myself. But I need to save it because it's such a little jar.

Anyways definitely try this if you have been searching for something to help with problem rashes or excessive dry skin. I'm so happy and my little one isn't scratching as much today. Thank you thank you!!!!",true,false,,

Now, my daughter suffers from severe eczema and she has been suffering from birth.
They turn into red patches and when my daughter scratches it, it splits open and starts bleeding.
This year was the worst, she would scratch till the point where she is looking like she came back from the battlefield.
As a parent, it's so heartbreaking.
Her pediatrician has recommended all sorts of creams and ointments but they were all no help.
I found this on Amazon and had to order it.
I was very skeptical at first, I mean, come on, prescription medications don't work on her, would this work?
YES!
It works!
I put this on her 3 times a day and since it is a bit chilly, I put long sleeves on her so she can't touch it.
It first turned into light pink then white then went away in 4 days!
Can you believe this?!
It is beyond amazing!
It is super oily but it doesnt stain clothes and the smell isn't the greatest but it's really not bad!
So try try try!!!!",true,false,,

Doctor says he'll grow out of it, but he scratches day and night until his cheeks bleed! As his mother, it's so hard to watch him suffer. I'm also tired of people asking me what's wrong with his face whenever we go out. I've spent money on many creams (prescription, otc, herbal) that would only work in the beginning but never really healed his skin. In fact, I think some just made the condition worse.

I was getting desperate and searched Amazon for eczema creams and found this. Initially, I used this for a day and stopped because I thought it was not working - I thought it was making it worse since his cheeks got a little more red. I put this away and used another balm I was testing out. Once I ran out of the other balm, I decided to give this another try. I would apply it throughout the day and started to notice some improvement. It has been 2 weeks now and although not completely healed, his skin is getting better. No more weeping or oozing either! I am halfway through the jar and will purchase more as I am actually seeing some results. Hopefully this will be ""the one""!

Minus 1 star for the scent. I know it is naturally unscented but because of that, it has this oily/greasy scent. I'm not a big fan and it makes my baby smell funny. Also, for those who start using this, don't expect instant results. It may take a few days to see improvement like I did. It probably depends on the severity of your skin issue.",true,false,,

However, I used this healing balm and the next day it looked like nothing was wrong. My daughter used one of my mud masks. While I loved it and did not break out, she broke out in a horrible rash. I was at a loss about what to put on her face. It was full of red blotches. I put this on her face and the next day her skin was clear. I also suffer from eczema, particularly around my wrists. This healing balm has cleared it up. Would our skin have improved without this, maybe in a few of the situations.

My Review:
My 6-month old has severe eczema from food and pet allergies. We changed his diet but it takes up to 3 months for pet dander to fully leave a house so we were worried we'd be using steroid creams and have a very itchy baby for 3 months. After using this a couple times I started to notice his skin was less red. I feel like this product is definitely helping our severe case (we use it at every diaper change on his arms and legs). So far it is the only product to show results without having to pair it with the steroid cream. I can see the area impacted by eczema shrinking as I continue to use this product. Very happy and would suggest this to people who have tried everything else like me!",false,false,,

She also had a diaper rash that wouldn't clear up. We tried probably 7 or so different creams/pastes including a prescription yeast cream, but after using this on her face and seeing good results, we tried it on her bottom as well. It allowed the sores on her bottom to start healing and reduced redness with just one application!!

I used it on a diaper rash that cleared up faster than it came, after 1 time of applying it the rash was gone which was wonderful because trying a new product can be hit or miss. My infant has a dry spot that has popped up a few times and applying a small amount of the healing ointment has cleared it up immediately whenever it surfaces. I have also used it on my hands when they have been very dry and it locked in the moisture. I wills say you do not need a lot of product so the little tub will last quite a while and if you do use too much it is hard to get off but that means you get to use it in small amounts and you won't go through it really fast.

Also the texture of his skin never changed, even if it wasn't red it was very rough. After one week of using the Healing Ointment for babies, his skin looks and feels completely normal. This is nothing short of amazing. He no longer wakes up crying and scratching- and seeing my baby no longer in pain is worth much more then this little jar costs. He also likes this cream better- he says it doesn't ""burn"" like the Aveeno baby after application.

Tired of seeing false advertisement saying you can use this balm on your baby's face and even your lips only to find that it dries out your lips like the Sahara Desert? I've tried SO many- Zoe, Trader Joes, Earth Mama Angel Baby- but nothing compares to this Healing Balm.

My 1.5 year old got a boo boo on his little nose and I smeared this on it, 2 days later, 95% healed. My lips were chapped from drinking too much coffee over the course of 2 days, so I slathered this on and by evening time- my lips felt soft, healed, and supple. I am about to order another to keep in the car since none of the above seems to be helping much in terms of moisturizing, healing, or keep the skin protected. Also, it smells like honey- not overpowering- JUST right!

We went tubing in January in the snow, it was windy and cold- I put this on my children's face as well as mine and we walked away from 3 hours in the elements with smooth, soft skin. No one chapped or bled or got dry!

I truly believe this is a hidden gem of a product. I wish it was available when my second was born because this would have been a life saver in the breast feeding department.

Honestly made well, honest ingredients, and they really, really care about their customers feedback. If you ever need to ask a question- Tyler answers ALL his emails personally and has become quite a good friend in terms of helping me learn more about organic ingredients and their effectiveness.

You won't be sorry utilizing this product for anything- everyday use- chapped lips, dry hands, your children's dry patches, eczema- it really helps everything so effectively. What more could you ask for in a product?!

I can guarantee that I will be sending my best friend who gives birth to her first baby in April a care package full of Era Organics.

I am attaching a picture because all these words could be useless unless you see a picture. My eldest broke out in some all over body rash and I used coconut oil, shea butter products, and nothing helped. I decided to use the balm on 3/31/16 and took a picture after application (on the left) that's why his skin looks ""shiny"". 24 hours later, I went to check his back to reapply and was shocked by how much better his back looked!!! on 4.1.16, which is the picture on the right. The redness was gone, the bloody scabby rash part was, and his skin smoothed over almost completely.

What I mean by this is that it just didn't seem to absorb well, which is partly the point, but she said that once it got on her hands it was greasy and difficult to remove or rub in. I took the balm back and used it on my feet that are quite dry. I would put on my feet at night and then cover with socks. In the morning my feet were very shiny and probably stayed very hydrated. But like her, the task of having to get it into or off my hands was a chore. Opening the bathroom doorknob required a Kleenex to turn it which is why I deducted 1 more star.

I really loved this product after my first purchase. It seemed that my baby's eczema started going away - and it was barely noticeable, her skin was very soft and not dry nor bumpy. So, I ordered second container...When it arrived it was packed the same way as the first order - when i opened it, it had completely different texture and it smelled like chocolate for whatever reason.
I used it anyways, and the very next day my baby got rash on her legs and mainly her elbows - it looked like an allergic reaction to this product. Not sure why 1st order worked out so well, but not the 2nd.
I just need consistency when it comes to my babys skin.

Old Review: I primarily bought this product to treat my 15 months old baby eczema, and end up using it for diaper rash instead of aquaphor as well!
So far I love it! I even used it for my chapped lips the other day - and it helped a lot.
It does not have any smell - which I also like, but I guess it will depend on the person! Container itself is small, which was my expectation from the very start because it says that it is 2oz - but it is well worth the money!",true,false,,

She developed baby acne/eczema at 4 weeks and her skin became very dry and irritated, especially on both cheeks and on her forehead. Her chin wasn't too bad, but the small bumps were even on her neck, near her little ears. As a baby with darker skin/melanin, I've known that I need to be careful not to pick or try to exfoliate the skin on her face as it may cause hyperpigmentation scarring. So, I just gently wipes her face with a mild, dye/fragrance/paraben free soap and water (mostly cool water), then I'd apply a bit of the healing balm to her must troubling areas at night. Sure, it was a little greasy and shiny but, I didn't care...she was going to bed. By day 6 of doing this, her skin was completely healed and her beautiful baby smooth texture returned!

She had been using mustela water already so no issues there. But adding this ointment caused her face and neck to breakout looking like uncontrollable baby acne. No issues with earth mama products or vanicream but for some reason, this made her smooth cheeks (aside from those few dry patches near her ear and above her eye brows) bumpy.

Around 1 month, she stared getting little bumps on her legs, applied it & BOOM! Gone within 48 hours.
My older kids had bug bites, they were terribly itchy, we applied this product & it eased their itching right away.
My 11 year old was getting some wired bumps on her face..not acne (she gets that too) & this stuff cleared her face up the next morning.
This stuff is seriously a miracle in a bottle. I wish I would have taken before & after pics of everything!
I use the complete moisturize & I love it. I'm on my 2nd bottle now.

OOPS. Sorry.

I purchased E-RA Organics because my children have extremely sensitive skin. We must be cautious regarding fragrance, coloring and other ingredients that are often found in major brand baby products even though they are sensitive skin products. For this reason, I typically make a mixture of shea butter and coconut oil. It's inconvenient, expensive and honestly Grandma won't use the home made concoction at her house. Enter E-RA healing balm. It is colorless and doesn't have any odor. It feels thick and similar to coconut oil(solid) with a slight waxy feel. It's not super greasy.
I first purchased the diaper balm for chaffing on my daughter's thighs. It worked remarkably. So I went on to purchase the healing balm for eczema dry patches on my daughters back, neck and scalp. With Afro Latino children, the skin is already needing lots of moisture. Often store bought ointments and lotions don't moisturize the skin enough OR they leave my child looking like a greased Thanksgiving Butterball. E-RA Organics Honeybuns healing balm was a great middle ground, it does not leave a greasy feeling while still moisturizing the skin. Within 3-4 uses, I could see the areas of irritation/dryness begin to get smaller and since have disappeared altogether.

It's gotten colder outside and I also began using this on my older, 6 year old son, for irritation on his red runny nose. He said it doesn't burn when applied and it helps make his nose ""happy"". So if you need a great skin solution but don't want to worry about sensitive skin/allergy, fragrance, additives, or just chemical poop storms being applied to your baby's skin, this is the product for you :)",false,false,,
R1R06JG7V8YOP7," GREASY feeling but works well",matthew c.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGFNYD3IRLRDAP73JBT4KWL4J5Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4,"November 8, 2016","I bought this healing balm mainly for my 3 year old, who gets pretty bad eczema, especially once it starts getting colder out. Even though I knew it was only 2 oz., the container was a little smaller than I anticipated (it fit right in the middle of my hand). I think that it smells great (think shea butter) but it is extremely greasy. My son doesn't mind the greasy feeling but I would have rated it lower if it had been for me because I really don't like feeling greasy. This balm worked great for the eczema on my son's shoulder/back but, as stated by the company, with natural ingredients it did take about a week of applying it to show results. It worked well being that the eczema was on his back and the balm could be covered by a shirt. I would worry about the greasiness rubbing off onto other surfaces if it had been used on his arm or leg etc. My husband (this review is under his account, not mine!) has a dairy intolerance and gets red, dry skin on his face often.

I had bought something similar years ago, so when I came across this baby healing ointment, thought, ""go on, give it a try"". I am so glad I did! This stuff is nice and thick.

The balm is not overly sticky or thick. This was important because my kids tend to use too much when they have to try harder to get it out of the container. I know that doesn't make sense, but it's true. If they have to push harder into the product, they quickly end up pushing too hard and pulling out a fingerful instead of a small bit.

The smell is pleasantly unnoticeable. Also important for one of my children who is sensitive to smells.

Then it really does the trick of moisturizing and protecting. This is great for the dry air of winter. Just take care not to slather it on. It is not meant to go on thick. It will absorb into the skin easily, so just use a thin layer.
The balm has a very faint natural smell - chamomile perhaps? The color is an almost clear yellow, no added colors.
I noticed that when my fingers are very cold it does not spread well, so I warm my hands a little first to make it softer. It is made from natural oils that are solid at room temperature.
I would definitely recommend trying this product.

Lately I've been using it and it has been irritating to my skin.

I like that this is a family owned company and that they use good, clean, organic ingredients, but unfortunately the balm is not that healing for us. It may work on your skin, though, since everyone's skin is different. Whatever lotions/creams you use, it's important to switch them up every now and then or else your skin gets used to it and the lotion/cream is not as effective.

Don't think that there is a magic cure lotion or balm for eczema, but side note: For those curious and suffering with eczema or knows someone who is suffering with eczema, some of the things we used to treat our toddler's eczema naturally that have helped at one point or another include Emily Skin Soother for Angry Red skin, All Good Goop, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Jojoba Oil, Organic Rosehip Oil, Organic Argan Oil, Honest Company Organic Healing Balm, Probiotic Spray, Oral probiotics like Prescript-Assist and Klaire Therbiotic Detoxification Probiotics, Organic Hemp Oil, tallow balm, Moon Valley Organics Eczecalm, Apple Valley Natural Soap's Herbal Salve, Motherlove Diaper Rash and Thrush salve, Organic Olive Oil, calendula baths, cilantro baths, bentonite clay baths, epsom salt baths, goat milk soap, fermented foods, soapnuts for laundry, keeping the house clean, washing our son's sheets frequently in hot water, drinking filtered drinking water, showering in filtered water so there's no chlorine, eating omega-3s (salmon, sardines, chia), gelatin, bone broth, apple cider vinegar, cilantro smoothies, green smoothies, green juices, fermented cod liver oil, turmeric/ginger/garlic/coconut oil, vitamin D (from sunlight and as a supplement (Thorne Vit D/K2), clean/organic/grassfed/pastured/wild diet of veggies/fruits/egg yolks/meat/chicken/fish; cotton/organic cotton clothing, and eliminating gluten/dairy.)

Also, try listening to the Phoenix Helix Podcast or visiting phoenixhelix.com (regarding autoimmmunity) or going to Sarah Ballantyne's website (thepaleomom.com) to find information about the AIP (autoimmune paleo protocol), which we tried to use to heal our son's gut.

For the cradle cap, if you can't find something that works and coconut oil/other oils is not working, but making it worse, I have been using a baking soda/water paste (leave it on the scalp for a minute) followed by some alba unpetroleum jelly.
