Our 3 month old had a really red/dry/flakey patch on her cheek and we started using the eucerine eczema lotion which helped a ton and then we used this for one day and her patch is almost all the way gone. We also use the eczema lotion on her torso and legs and it’s helped get rid of little bumps she was getting all over. Definitely recommend!!

**we also tried Burt’s bees, mustela and aveeno eczema lotions and they didn’t even compare to the eucerine eczema products!!",true,false,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Eob052zcL.jpg

For the most part his skin has been usually rough and bumpy throughout his face and body. As soon as I noticed his problem I began using Aveeno lotion and wash. But his skin continued to get worse. I switched to exederm which helped his skin but didn't take the roughness and dryness away. While I continued to manage his skin condition, still it being rough and dry my baby had a really bad ""flare up"". He developed raw patches behind his knees, neck and arms. I was extremely stressed out and he didn't have an appointment until the week after. In the meantime I ordered several lotions to try. The first one I used was Eucerin eczema baby. I put lotion on him several times a day, just like I did with the ones I previously tried on him. The next day, my baby's face was no longer red or rough, still appeared a bit dry. The lotion didn't appear to sting or burn. By the second day I used this lotion, his skin was soft, and no longer dry. You have to give a try. I will stock up on Eucerin eczema baby for as long as I have to. I love how it helped my baby.

This is my honest review and I have NOT received anything in exchange for my review.",true,false,,,

I have a 5 month old and we’ve been trying to figure out a (non-steroidal) solution for his eczema for 2.5months. We’ve been applying the cream (the 2oz flair up cream) 2-3 times/day for about 4 days and already see a dramatic difference both in the appearance of his rash and his level of comfort. I use the Eucerin on his face because that’s where his eczema is the worst. (I use Cera-ve on the rest of his body and that seems to keep the body patches well controlled.) The cream is a little expensive but so are most eczema creams right? This one works for us- not promising it will work for your baby but definitely worth a try.,true,false,,,

The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because I cannot put it on him after I give him a bath if he does have an eczema flare up because it seems to burn and he cries a lot. However if his pores are not open it works very well and he doesn't seem to have any pain. Other creams seem to just lie on the surface and his skin is rough and dry within minutes. This cream lasts long and he feels so smooth and supple. Works great as a maintenance cream or as a barrier cream when using steroids or other medications for problem skin.,true,false,,,

I bought this through amazon (great value) and her stomach is so smooth and soft it’s incredible. Completely different skin on her stomach. I even wrote a thank you letter to the company.

After a dose of antibiotics, my 2 year old got a horrible reaction to the medicine that broke out his entire body.

This cream and a regular regimen of organic kids probiotics solved the problem. It took only days to see the results. Not to mention a little goes a LONG way. It has now been a few months and his skin is still eczema free!!!!! I highly recommend this cream in combination with probiotics to cure your baby's eczema.

I recently got very bad hives from an anaphylactic reaction at work two months ago, and this patch of dry skin just wouldn’t go away. I tried various creams and remedies, even drinking benadryl but nothing worked. I bought three different types of cortizone creams, since it was very much recommended by everyone and their mothers, but I felt that the dry skin was getting even worse, swollen AND itchier. My sister in law then recommended this cream to me, and I was astounded since I believed “the cream is only meant for babies though?”

Yet, I still purchased it. And after one use, as you can see in the picture, I saw a HUGE difference. My skin went from a rough crusty patch of dragon scales to a semi softness I’ve been dying to feel for weeks now. The itchiness completely stopped, the redness went away, and I am just in awe.

It’s the same price for a 2 oz tube vs. the 5 oz tube of the baby eczema relief cream. I like the eczema relief cream but my 4 month old has rashes on her face that are worse than the rest of her body so I wanted to use the baby eczema relief cream on her whole body like I have been and then got the “flare up treatment” for her face and it’s absolutely the same so I’m frustrated that I didn’t just buy the 5 oz tube for the same price because we have been going through that like crazy.,true,false,,,

When I tell you my baby had dry skin, I. Mean. DRY! We tried many many lotions. We got to the point where were covering him head to toe in coconut oil 3x per day for a couple of week and his skin was still raw and flaking from dryness; in fact, it was getting worse. His skin was so sad that our pediatrician suggested it might be coinciding with a food allergy.

We tried a sample of this lotion before his first eczema flare up and I liked it. So, desperate after the failed coconut oil, I bought a full sized bottle. It arrived yesterday. I used this head to toe instead of coconut oil at bedtime and this morning his skin looked INCREDIBLE! No more patchy redness, no more flaking. Just a little discoloration from his own chub rub. He’s been so much happier this morning. He seems so comfortable.

He cried so hard he threw up and was gasping for breath. I've never been so terrified! Nothing would calm him and I considered calling an ambulance because it was so extreme. Finally as I'm checking his body trying to figure out why he's in such pain, I saw red patches starting to pop up all over his legs. I immediately put him back in the bath and washed with Aveeno.

The baby dove was sold out everywhere, and this was cheaper online than baby dove so I decided to try it.It had good reviews here and on YouTube, said by parents with children with eczema. I figured it would be good, especially because eucerin makes aquaphor, and that works great for us for other issues(redness,rash,scratch,scrape, etc). I put this on my son, and his skin broke out like I’ve never seen or break out before.Every single little tiny bump of his skin was raised(like goosebumps) but it wouldn’t go away, and he kept scratching. After a few days I realized it was the new cream(at first I thought he was having more dairy, which makes his eczema worse).I’ve since stopped using it on him, and his skin went back to normal.Not great for sensitive skin, so maybe test one leg or arm for a few days first.I don’t want to waste it, so I’ve been using it on my daughter who doesn’t have eczema nor sensitive skin, but skin has been getting a bit dry from the weather maybe(usually not dry).She likes it and says it smells good, so I’ll just continue using it as her moisturizer, only til it’s gone.Won’t be buying again.One last thing, the thickness is supposed to be pretty thick and creamy, but it’s not, it’s close to liquidy like a regular lotion.Baby dove eczema cream definitely thicker and creamier but not too thick.

I had used Mustela, Amazon brand Mamabear lotion, and neither of them did anything, they were too watery and the Mustela is very strongly scented, especially for a newborn. (their other products are good, but the lotion in particular had such a strong scent!) My daugher's pediatrician said not to bother with any ""lotions"" that only creams or aquaphor type products would do the trick for eczema and she was right.

Her skin was dry and void of any moisture. On top of it, she turned out to have so many allergies pertaining to her skin so we were truly limited with what we could use on her. It seemed as though that regardless of what ""natural"" or ""organic"" solution we were using on her, would make her break out in hives. On top of that, through an elimination diet, we found out she was allergic to casein which would make her eczema significantly worse while giving her hives.

Fast-forward to now, she's just gotten over three allergic reactions this past month to either soap or a brand of cereal that didn't note milk in its ingredient list. As a last chance before we saw the dermatologist for the 5th time, we decided to try Eucerin Baby Eczema products since she does well with Aquaphor (same company). Although its been one day, the results are amazing! No hives! No outbreaks! Soft, baby soft, skin! We put the itch therapy cream on first after her bath to soak in and then the lotion. Her skin is SO moisturized this morning, her eczema patches that I would have to place Aquaphor on are healing faster and she's scratching less on her patches. I don't think anyone, except mothers and father who have gone through a similar situation, can understand the joy this brings to my soul to not see my child in discomfort everyday.

I've been told that if the first ingredient is water, it's not going to do much for you, but almost all commercial moisturizers have water as the first ingredient. This Eucerin has oatmeal as the first. And it does make a difference.

THE GREAT:
+ Thick and rich and smooth; feels great (I personally don't feel the ""cooling sensation"" though)
+ Goes on beautifully with no tugging, and also no extraneous wiping of watery finish, and also no greasiness
+ Works - leaves yucky dry winter skin smooth and soft
+ Lasts - doesn't need frequent reapplications

Works fabulously on very dry flaking skin. Love.",false,true,,,

At first I thought the dry spots would go away with more lotion and TLC.... I was using Aveeno baby, Aquaphur ointment, and unscented everything on her to avoid any skin issues. The dryness remained and it started to get worse and worse, it was so rough! The red spots on her torso I assumed were a different issue and reactions to her clothing, but after checking with dr google I realized she may be dealing with a bit of baby eczema in both areas!! I jumped on Amazon to try something asap targeted for that issue before dragging her to the Dr with Covid happening over a bit of skin issues...im sure the dr would say it could be anything since babies have such sensitive skin.

Anyway, I bought this based on reviews and WAS AMAZED. I put it on at night before bed and the next morning her arms were about 50% better and soft again!!! Her red areas on her chest were also almost gone!! I cant believe how FAST this worked after all the other baby creams and oil I had tried on her before!! I put it on her 2x a day for a week to clear everything fully, backed off to once a day at night, and now just use it as spot treatment as needed.

The cream gave her no irritation and has no smell to it (I hate anything lotion/cream-wise with smells added) if you are dealing with any skin issues just give this a try! Worked for me as well as the others leaving reviews here, so it is worth a shot!",true,false,,,

I have been using this on my 2 month old since he was 2weeks after pediatrician's recommendation. At the time, he really had very bad rash all over his body. And the pediatrician gave us some samples to try out, she also said we could either use this or Aquaphor or cerave. I have got both of them at my home except this eucerin eczema relief. But none of them helped him as much as this eucerin. Just like the docto saidr, I was using lot of cream everytime on him and apply 3 to 4 times a day or whenever I remember. I kept the tube handy at bed side and every time I am on bed feeding him I was applying. Sometimes even if it's not the whole body at least the parts like face,hands and legs that are exposed. Within couple of days I saw great improvement. His skin was getting smoother. Within a week everyone else could feel and tell the difference since his skin tone got pretty without that rash. It's like, my friends and family were asking me, ""hey, what did you do, his skin magically changed and he looks pretty now"". That made me real happy.

Once I was out of the sample tubes, I started using the aquaphor that I use on my 3 year old all the time. But no, it's not working, he is going back to that rough skin. I am not sure why is that, coz I have been using Aquaphor on my 3 year old ever since he was a baby and it worked great for him but not for my little one. So I have ordered these on amazon, I am using it daily and it's just working great.

So if you or your kid has skin issues try this out. Never know which one works for your skin. By the way, I personally use and love Cerave very much .
One tip, which ever you decide to use, apply it right after bath. Looks like the moisturizer is better absorbed that way. It's like damp sponge absorb more water than a dry one. Hope this helps.",true,false,,,

1. Aveeno Oatmeal bath soaks every 2 days. Wash in Aveeno Eczema moisturizing wash from head to toe. Once bath time is over pat dry but lightly and apply next Aveeno product.
2. After bath time within 2 mins and after each diaper change apply Aveeno night time balm (aka Aveeno Vaseline, thick and non greasy)
3. Use Desonide steroid ointment (doctor said this is the lowest strength so not as bad as high strength steroid cream on infants) as need to put out flare ups

It is made even worse during the winter months. His main problem area is his hands from the habitual hand washing. I have used a plethora of eczema creams and ointments; including prescription topical treatments. This product is by far the best.

The biggest factors that make this product superior to all others is two fold. First, it is odor and sting free! When dealing with a 5 year old, having to convince him to put on the cream regularly is hard enough. Mix in a burning stinky treatment, and you have utter failure. Second, this product is nice and thick. The key in treating eczema is keeping the area moist and hydrated. Most competitive products fail miserably. They usually dry off and so does the skin and the itch is back. With Eucerin Eczema relief crème, it penetrates the skin, and lasts for hours. I try to apply the crème onto my kiddo's hands after every hand wash, and every four hours or so.

R12DLNZZTG6E1Y," Prehaps alright for more mild cases of Eczema",The Straw Man,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFOYDZYMYVVWYMJ5ZDSYFS6Z6P2Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,3,"May 6, 2014","I really had no idea what Eczema was until my son was born. He will be 28 months old and he has struggled with Eczema since his birth. For anyone who is not familiar with Eczema, allow me to provide a short primer. It is a condition of the skin, in which the skin becomes extremely dry, resulting in itching and rubbing to the point where the skin cracks and bleeds. In addition, when there is radical shift in the weather, hot to cold or vice versa this can really flare things up. In my son’s case, if he becomes stressed or vexed this will promote him to scratch and itch. One of the many things that can ameliorate Eczema is creams and topical ointments.

I feel I must note in regards of reviewing this product, my son is under the care of a dermatologist and his pediatrician for his Eczema. Yet, I am still on a quest to find anything to aid my son’s Eczema, because the symptoms can only be controlled, not stopped. The hope is that over time the child will grow out of it or it will become more of a minor situation as he/she ages.
With regards to this review, I stopped using all topical creams prescription and over the counter for three days to see how this lotion would work. The only medication my son was given while this cream by Eucerin was used was an oral prescription given by his dermatologist to reduce itching.

This lotion by Eucerin is promoted on the notion that it provides relief for baby Eczema. I have to say that I really didn’t see any change in my son’s skin after using this product for several days. His skin did not become any worse, yet did not improve beyond the way his skin looked before the first application of this lotion.

I would say this lotion allowed my son’s skin to not become worse, if I had to provide an educated guess towards the worth of this product. I would also add that Eczema is a very tricky and frustrating medical condition and no two babies are going to respond the same to it. My son’s dermatologist and pediatrician both have said that they have seen worse cases of Eczema than my son’s. Those statements are surprising, because there are times where my son is so miserable I cannot imagine how it could be any worse than it already is.

In conclusion, it could be possible that my son’s Eczema is beyond point of where this over the counter lotion can aid him. However, I do believe that it helped maintain his skin for a few days and I believe if a child has a more mild case of Eczema this lotion can be of a stronger benefit. Nevertheless, if you are a parent of a child (or children) who have Eczema I would strongly advise speaking with a dermatologist if you can, if nothing else, educating oneself about this condition is one of the best ways to combat it.",false,true,,,

I've not noticed much of a difference between the Body Creme and the Therapy Creme, only that it comes in a larger size. The ingredients and instructions are the same, and the product inside looks, smells and feels the same. So I'll attempt to summarize: our baby had very bad eczema and still suffers from flare ups. This was not a cure, but it moisturized him like nothing else we tried (and we tried a very long list of things: elimination diet, detergents elimination, natural moisturizers, botanicals, adult moisturizers, wet wraps, baking soda baths, oatmeal baths - if someone suggested it we gave it a shot.) It keeps him moisturized all day so we can slather him in it in the morning and his skin is soft until bath time when we slather him in it again. This didn't sting him like some of the other creams we tried, and we noticed he was less fidgety after we put this on his itchy areas. Ultimately a prescription from the pediatric dermatologist was what we needed to get things totally under control, but now we can use this alone for maintenance with great success.

As I mentioned in my other review, I'm pretty sure there is no difference between the baby version and the non-baby version of this lotion. Like the baby Aquaphor/adult Aquaphor bottles, it's simply branded differently so it can be easier to find in the baby section of stores. The ingredients are identical and the description and active ingredients are identical. Both say they can be used on babies, children, and adults.

Since the two products are very similar, I am writing this as a joint review.

I am not an infant. I have been an ezcema patient for over thirty years and I have tried more cream than I can remember. I am familiar with the Eucerin brand, but I think these are their newer offerings since in the past Eucerin is more of a competition to Cerave. However, these two Eucerin offerings are in fact more of a direct competitor to Aveeno because their active ingredient is Colloidal Oatmeal 1%, which is a skin protectant that is also used in many Aveeno creams.

Since they have the same active ingredient, there is really no significant difference in their performance in my experience with them over the last month. I don't think there is any surprise here. The two Eucerin offerings have reasonable smell (in fact the body cream smells quite like Aveeno), which is important: there is no fragrance since fragrance can potentially cause unnecessary skin irritation. Honestly, if you are already seeking out for ezcema treatment, that is the last thing you want. :)

The only difference between the two Eucerin offerings here is their thickness but NOT their concentration (both list the active ingredient at 1%). The body cream is thinner, while the “instant therapy” is thicker. In other words, the body cream creates a thinner moisture barrier, whereas the latter creates a thicker barrier. Personally I prefer the body cream since I don't like thick creams, but it is true that the body cream wears off faster since it is thinner.

As for the overall effect, well, I have to say that they are ok for everyday use. Honestly, I have already accepted my “fate” and I don't expect there is any cure to my ezcema. In this regard, these Eucerin products do not disappoint. They are good at keeping the skin protected, but they do not stop the itch or helps with the condition in the long term.

Eucerin products are almost all fragrance and dye free, and contain no irritating additives.

We used to live in a cold, desert climate, and the skin on my hands, and my children's hands would become dry and even bloody during the worst of the cold, dry season. After many years of trying all kinds of various products, Eucerin wins! Their ""repair"" line was one of the first I found to really work well on dry, chapped winter skin, and even the severe chapped areas of my children's skin from irritation or rubbing along the diaper gathers.

This particular product feels good on the skin, and gives almost instant relief to chapped, irritated skin. There is virtually no smell at all, and so far none of my very sensitive skinned family have had any reactions. The cream seems to work well, and quickly, and give almost instant relief and clears up the dry, painful skin in a few applications. All of us have episodes of allergic eczema, and so far both myself and my three children have tried the product with great success.

This cream is EXPENSIVE, and I am unclear why this particular formulation is better used for babies than some of the other, equally good, and much cheaper Eucerin products on the market.

I figured anyone could use it since it's dye, fragrance and steroid free, not just for babies. My hands have been particularly raw, chapped and uncomfortable this winter. I also use a lot of strong chemicals to clean with and that could be another reason for my skin issues.

My girlfriend has eczema and I thought she might benefit from trying it. She said it felt like applying water to her skin. It wasn't thick enough or have enough of an emollient base. She prefers natural products and uses shea butter, which works wonders for her skin.

At the time, there were no visible signs of eczema despite being winter. After a couple of days I noticed a couple of patches of eczema on her right arm. I would not use an adult OTC product to treat it so I picked this up at the local pharmacy. I selected this over similar products because I like Eucerin baby products having used them in the past.
I continued to bathe her in a lukewarm bath with Eucerin baby wash and then applied this to the patchy areas 3-4 x a day. The outbreak calmed down over the weekend and her skin was back to normal by Monday. I continued usage until her parents came home.
I liked this product because it creates a moisture barrier on the skin and keeps the skin moist and itch free. My tiny tot had no allergic reaction to it and it delivered almost immediate relief. The addition of oatmeal was great. I take oatmeal baths when my eczema flares up and it always makes things better.

His entire cheek area was weeping so I spent a whole day and night doing wet compresses and gently patting him dry in between compresses until it began to dry out. I then put a tiny bit of steroid cream on his cheeks while he slept with this eczema cream ontop and the instant relief version because he was tearing at his face and neck.

Steroid cream with aquaphor hadn't even done this. I continued to use cream every few hours and the crust that formed had began to peel back, after one day had completely peeled and healed.

This cream was easy to use, didn't sting/burn with application like some creams do and the small package enabled me to keep it in my purse for times her dry skin got itchy while we were out and about. I'm not sure it ""cures"" her eczema, but the fact that it is so mild yet to hydrating is a huge win for us. Great product!",false,true,,,
