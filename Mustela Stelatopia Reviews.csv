R16BGV5KHMV9QT," Reddened baby face-- and includes sunflower oil!",ali,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFO3XEEKK3KE25LQYGIRP536LSAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2,"December 23, 2019","I really wanted this to work. My baby has some combo of cradle cap/eczema on his forehead, but either way, this only seemed to make it redder. I tried it twice before bed over the course of a week-- and his skin just looked more irritated. My Dr recommended mineral oil and after a month of avoiding it (because petroleum product), I finally used food grade (no fragrance) mineral oil last night after baby's bath. His skin looks 10 times better this morning. I guess there is a reason why it's considered the holy grail-- and there is a ton of misinformation about it online.

Another strike against this product is that it includes sunflower oil, which a respected 2016 study found disrupted the ability of newborn's skin to form its protective barrier.

Although this didn’t work as planned, I do appreciate Amazon/Mustela accepting my return. The package states that it’s gentle for even the most sensitive skin, which wasn’t the case here.

The company stood behind its product (which is rare); this gives me confidence that this particular cream probably does work for most other babies.
