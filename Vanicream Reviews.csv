R3N0ADD1AW5I2A," Contains BHT",CJ,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH4YB5ZEFH665NEW5CYWR3IRP5GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,2,"October 25, 2019","Originally our pediatrician recommended this lotion based on her dermatologist colleagues reviews. Because our little guy was going through some uncomfortable eczema flare ups on his face and arms we were willing to try any relief at that point.

The initial use was super effective- it added a nice moisturizing layer that seemed to soothe his skin almost immediately. We loved it until we started reading the ingredient list and noticed that it contained something called BHT.

Going down the google rabbit hold you'll see that this is found mostly in stuff like cereals, lipsticks etc because its a food preservative. Basically it prevents the chemical bond in fats and oils from transforming into different chemicals which may have foul smells when it comes it contact with oxygen. Bottom line - it's kind if scary. But I guess anything synthetic is really.

Anyhow the FDA deems this product as generally safe but the National Institute of Health says its reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. Wow! I wasn't ready to start taking our chances no matter how low the dose of BHT was or how beautifully it worked on his skin.

Needless to say we made the decision to return and started treating it with coconut oil.",true,false,

One person gave this wash a one-star review stating that disodium EDTA is a formaldehyde-releasing agent which is completely false.

A few different people and a lot of online reviews recommended Vanicream Baby Wash so I decided to give it a try.

The ingredients in Vanicream are pretty straight forward: Purified Water; Glycerin; Coco Glucoside; Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate; Acrylates Copolymer; Caprylyl Glycol; Mica; Sodium Chloride; 1,2 Hexanediol; Titanium Dioxide; Sodium Hydroxide; and Disodium EDTA.

My first impression of Vanicream Baby Wash was a really good one. It was fragrance free like it promised, it lathered well, and made my skin feel smooth the first time I washed my hands with it. However, after using the product for three days my hand started to break out in a bad, bloody rash.

Upon development of the rash I stopped using Vanicream Baby Wash, but the rash would not go away. I tried every lotion, anti itch cream, and rash cream I've ever used in my life and nothing worked. Hydrocortisone even failed to clear it up. Eventually my doctor gave me a prescription steroid cream which cleared the rash up.

I cannot recommend this product for sensitive skin as I have extremely sensitive skin and developed a bad rash. I don't know which ingredient caused it, but Vanicream Baby Wash is definitely not the right body wash for me.",true,false,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YdCx0DGvL.jpg
